At the end of their fight with the ghost captain, the party licked their wounds, while [[Leaklan Plateau|Leaklan]] investigated the ledger from the coffer that [[Eden Lockton|Eden]] had recovered. The ledger detailed collusion between [[Captain Perry Kieran]], presumably the ghost, and several mid-level administrators in the [[Balaika|Balaikan]] government. The captain appeared to be something of a ring leader in skimming off of the tithe that [[Balaika]] pays to the pirates for protection from their former overlord [[Veriduna]]. He also determined that the locket that the ghost was interested in was not magical. Unable to go to sleep after the ghost attack, [[Leaklan Plateau|Leaklan]] joined [[Yllavyre Enallyna|Ylla]] for his watch, which proceeded without incident.

The following morning, [[Sonja Krieg|Sonja]], one of the castaways, approached [[Yllavyre Enallyna|Ylla]] about trying to capture one of the pterodon creatures. Agreeing to help, [[Yllavyre Enallyna|Ylla]] recruited the rest of the party to assist. After discussion, they decided that it would be easier to steal an egg than to capture an adult pterodon. [[Leaklan Plateau|Leaklan]] and [[Mayak]] attempted to lure in the birds with fish, drawing the attention of one of the pair of pterodons that the party found, while [[Astoria Grimaldi|Stori]], [[Eden Lockton|Eden]], and [[Sonja Krieg|Sonja]] made a play for their nest.

[[Yllavyre Enallyna|Ylla]] confirmed with a tree that the creatures were not endangered. [[Leaklan Plateau|Leaklan]] held one of the pterodons in a bear hug while it peaked at him repeatedly, and [[Mayak]] attacked it with his lance. The duo finished it off with [[Leaklan Plateau|Leaklan]] biting its beak off.

Meanwhile, [[Sonja Krieg|Sonja]] used [[Eden Lockton|Eden's]] intestines to repel down to the pterodon nest on the cliff face and recover an egg. [[Astoria Grimaldi|Stori]] took potshots at the nearby pterodon, while [[Sonja Krieg|Sonja]] attempted to climb [[Eden Lockton|Eden's]] intestines with her assistance. The pterodon would eventually knock [[Sonja Krieg|Sonja]] off of the intestines, sending her crashing back to the nest unconscious.

In an attempt to help, [[Yllavyre Enallyna|Ylla]] attempted to jump to the nest but failed to grab the intestines as he fell and crashed unconscious. [[Leaklan Plateau|Leaklan]] attempted to leap and grab the remaining pterodon but barely missed and crashed into the nest unconscious as well.

[[Astoria Grimaldi|Stori]] managed to land three arrows on the remaining pterodon in quick succession, dropping it onto her friends in the nest below. She then joined [[Mayak]] in climbing down [[Eden Lockton|Eden's]] intestines to help their friends. The duo managed to resuscitate them while [[Eden Lockton|Eden]] kept watch for more pterodons.

Once safely back on the cliff, [[Yllavyre Enallyna|Ylla]] carved up the pterodon duo for food. The group disseminated some first aid before returning to their camp with the egg and performing more healing.

With a few hours of daylight left, the party elected to explore the branch of the trail that they hadn't taken yet, encountering more vine traps on the way, before [[Astoria Grimaldi|Stori]] found a campsite for the night.

The following morning, [[Yllavyre Enallyna|Ylla]] climbed a tree to try to get more bearings of the island. In doing so, he spotted the partially collapsed roof of a wooden hut and a splash of vibrant color through the trees. The party decided to investigate the color and came upon an eccentric-looking hut made of various scavenged driftwood and several vibrant umbrellas.

Peering through a gap in the wood, [[Yllavyre Enallyna|Ylla]] saw a wiry, twitchy kobold with a sword much like his own arguing with a hermit crab. The party knocked politely, and after confirming that they weren't ghosts were let in.

[[Yllavyre Enallyna|Ylla]] questioned the kobold, who identified himself as [[Jib]], about his sword. [[Jib]] said that his friend Captain Rayka Sahli of the Driftwood gifted it to him. He indicated that they had resided at the campsite near the castaway's primary campsite after shipwrecking on the island. [[Yllavyre Enallyna|Ylla]] briefly traded his own sword with [[Jib]] to investigate it before handing it back. 

Jib revealed that there were cannibals on the island. [[Astoria Grimaldi|Stori]] managed to convince [[Jib]] to return with them to their camp. [[Jib]] asked if they knew the other two new people that he saw a few days ago, providing descriptions of [[Captain Oakley]] and [[Irena]]. He noted that he'd seen them traveling further inland.

The party then returned to camp with [[Jib]], and several umbrellas, in tow.
