[[The Crooked Crow]] sailed to the wreck of [[Encounter 2 - The Siren's Call|The Siren's Call]] to collect the second tablet piece. Once there the Jibblets had crewmembers row them out to the wreck, above a coral reef outcropping, where the ship had run aground. [[Yllavyre Enallyna|Ylla]] cast water breathing for the party members who were unable to breathe underwater, and the Jibblets descended. Aboard the ship. [[Leaklen Plateau|Leaklen]] found the captain's quarters, the place where the tablet allegedly was, but encountered a giant octopus who was territorial. The Jibblets managed to drive off the creature after a hard-fought battle.

Once the octopus had fled, [[Leaklen Plateau|Leaklen]] tailed by [[Eden Lockton|Eden]] and [[Mayak]], investigated the captain's quarters. [[Leaklen Plateau|Leaklen]] found a dented iron lockbox, which he returned with to the surface. [[Mayak]] removed the rapier and dagger from the corpse of the captain, impaled on a large wood splinter. Meanwhile, [[Astoria Grimaldi|Stori]] searched the rest of the ship finding a magic wand, which she would later give to [[Eden Lockton|Eden]] back on [[The Crooked Crow]]. 

Back aboard [[The Crooked Crow]] [[Leaklen Plateau|Leaklen]] realized that he didn't have a way to open the box, so [[Astoria Grimaldi|Stori]] picked its lock and threw it on the deck, to bust it open.

As the ship approached the location of the third tablet piece, [[Captain Vanessa Lycander|Captain Lycander]] briefed the Jibblets that the final piece of the tablet was kept with a ruin guardian that her late husband had entrusted it with; she also noted that there was a tribe native to the island and she wasn't sure of its outlook. [[Yllavyre Enallyna|Ylla]] managed to clock that the captain seemed more excited than usual to get them off of the ship.

Worried about being stranded, [[Yllavyre Enallyna|Ylla]] conferred with the other Jibblets. They agreed to try to get the captain to come with them, and failing that, to take the tablet pieces with them 'for reference'. The captain refused the first request, citing a recent mutiny, and her lack of trust for much of the crew, however, was convinced to hand over one tablet piece to the Jibblets.

Before pushing off, [[Leaklen Plateau|Leaklen]] noticed a humanoid figure watching the ship from higher up the island, as well as some sea turtles.

The Jibblets took a rowboat to the island with [[Astoria Grimaldi|Stori]] swimming ahead. [[Astoria Grimaldi|Stori]] heard a familiar voice shouting in a familiar language at a pack of drakes that had cornered a couple of hippocampi on a beach. She sprung into action with the other Jibblets following her lead.

The Jibblets managed to kill the drake pack without either beached hippocampi dying.
