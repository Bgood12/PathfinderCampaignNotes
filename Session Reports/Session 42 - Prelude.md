The Jibblets return to [[Stormhaven]] to report back to [[The Admiral]]. While there, [[Leaklen Plateau|Leaklen]] notices his aunt [[Jaq (Jack) Harlow|Jaq's]] ship in harbor. The Jibblets then traveled to the staging area to await the [[Veriduna|Veridunan]] fleet. [[Eden Lockton|Eden]] sent messages to her brother Erick via the wand that she'd recovered from The Gilded Jasmine in [[Bloodwake Harbor]]. She told him where she was and that she may die soon. Somewhat taken aback, Erick told her to reach out once the danger had passed and that their parents were looking for her for some reason. While at the staging point, Jaq boarded [[The Howling Jib]] to look for [[Leaklen Plateau|Leaklen]] and was not bothered by his squaliform appearance. The Jibblets then gently teased him for his crush on [[Joseph (Sephy) Harlow]]. 

The [[Veriduna|Veridunan]] navy was spotted, and the assembled armada set off to meet it. During transit a group of devils appeared over [[The Howling Jib]]. One of them affixed a magical anchor to the ship to halt it. The Jibblets managed to dispatch the devils and noticed that the bulk of their armada had continued onward. They then set about trying to break the chain to remove the anchor, with [[Yllavyre Enallyna|Ylla]] managing to scratch it.
