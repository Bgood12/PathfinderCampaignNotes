The Jibblets attempted to persuade the crew of [[The Crooked Crow]] to their side over [[Captain Vanessa Lycander|Captain Lycander]] to what seemed like success. [[Mayak]] rowed the captain to shore, took her sword, and left her a hatchet - stranding her on the island. Meanwhile, [[Leaklen Plateau|Leaklen]] investigated the captain's quarters, finding a hidden floor compartment with 75.1 gold coins and a lockbox. [[Astoria Grimaldi|Stori]] opened the latter, finding the other two tablet pieces and a crudely drawn map. [[Mayak]], nominated by [[Leaklen Plateau|Leaklen]] to be captain, gave each crew member a gold piece and promoted [[Sticus]] to bosun.

[[Yllavyre Enallyna|Ylla]] used the map to navigate to the nearby island indicated, and the Jibblets waited until morning to head out. [[Luca Romano|Luca]] volunteered to watch the ship while the Jibblets were away to make sure that no one got up to anything. The Jibblets traveled through dense jungle following the map until they came to a cliff with a small waterfall. After some searching, [[Astoria Grimaldi|Stori]] read the psychometric resonance of the tablet. She pushed past feelings of paranoia and pragmatism to see an ogre leading others through a wall of water. After reading the resonance, the Jibblets decided to investigate behind the waterfall.

[[Leaklen Plateau|Leaklen]] and [[Mayak]] cut through the vines and leaves covering the rear wall of the alcove behind the waterfall in record time, revealing a pair of large granite doors with an image of ogres fighting humans with dragons overhead. 

[[Leaklen Plateau|Leaklen]] led the way through the underground structure, coming across a pool of water with a mosaic eye at the bottom, several large shelves on walls stacked in two layers, some broken furniture and old cutlery, and jail cells containing normal-sized human bones. He also found a statue of an ogre with a plaque. Having a sudden epiphany, [[Leaklen Plateau|Leaklen]] learned how to read Old Jotun and translated the poem. He and [[Astoria Grimaldi|Stori]] posited that the poem was some kind of nationalistic call.
```
The mighty may tower, 
But shadows see all.
We endure, we observe,
And when the time comes,
We strike with purpose,
For freedom, for strength, for all.
```

[[Astoria Grimaldi|Stori]] removed the eyes from the statue, a pair of black opals, and [[Leaklen Plateau|Leaklen]] found more elongated shelves stacked two tall. 

[[Leaklen Plateau|Leaklen]] then led the Jibblets into a room lined with tool assortments, many lying broken and scattered. Hearing a quartet of shambling creatures, [[Leaklen Plateau|Leaklen]] entered a rage.
