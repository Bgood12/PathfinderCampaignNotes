## Appearance
Tatsu is a rugged-looking human man in his mid-thirties, though his prematurely greying hair and beard make him appear much older. His weathered face and piercing, dark eyes reflect a life of hardship and internal turmoil. He wears well-kept but low-quality armor and clothing. His katana, equally well kept, is much more valuable. 

## Personality
Tatsu is a taciturn and reserved individual, finding little reason to smile and possessing no sense of humor. His stoic demeanor often makes him seem unapproachable, and he is quick to judge those he perceives as spoiled or wasteful. Tatsu's experiences have made him deeply pragmatic and somewhat cynical, valuing hard work and resourcefulness above all else.

## Backstory
Tatsu grew up aboard his father's merchant vessel, a floating home that sailed between distant ports. During these voyages, he witnessed the stability and roots that land-dwellers put down, sparking a deep-seated jealousy and longing for a more permanent home. In a moment of misguided desperation, Tatsu set his father's ship on fire, believing it would force his family to settle on land. The fire quickly spiraled out of control, and his father died trying to extinguish the flames.

Wracked with guilt and grief, Tatsu fled the scene, stowing away on a ship belonging to the Ekeko Consortium. For the next ten years, he performed miscellaneous and often menial tasks for the consortium, each day a reminder of his past mistakes. During this time, he was gifted a katana, a symbol of his indebtedness and a constant reminder of the honor he believed he had lost.

## Unique Traits
Tatsu has a habit of absentmindedly running his fingers over the hilt of his katana during moments of reflection or deep thought. This gesture could serve as a visual cue of his internal struggle.
