## Appearance
Tatsu is a rugged looking human man who looks much older than he actually is on account of his greying hair and beard. He wears well-kept though obviously low quality armor and clothing. His katana, equally well kept, is much more valuable.

## Personality
A taciturn man Tatsu finds little reason to smile and has no sense of humor. He dislikes those he perceives as spoiled or wasteful.

## Backstory
Tatsu grew up aboard his father's merchant vessel. During his many stops on land he witnessed the roots that people put down and got jealous. Fueled by jealous Tatsu set his father's ship on fire thinking that it would make his family put down roots. Tatsu's father died trying to put out the fire.
Distraught Tatsu stowed away on a ship of the [[Ekeko Consortium]]. Afterwords he did miscellaneous work for the consortium for 10 years. During that time he was gifted his katana as a means of making him view himself as further indebted with the group.

## Unique Traits
Tatsu has a habit of absentmindedly running his fingers over the hilt of his katana during moments of reflection or deep thought. This gesture could serve as a visual cue of his internal struggle.
