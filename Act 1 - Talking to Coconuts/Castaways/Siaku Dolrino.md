## Appearance
Siaku is a middle-aged human with a lean build. His black dreadlocks, swept to one side, are starting to show streaks of gray, hinting at his advancing age and the stress of his experiences. He has watery brown eyes which reflect a sense of curiosity or weariness dependent on the situation.

Siaku wears tattered clothing, remnants of his former life, and his hands are bound behind his back. His posture is slightly hunched, not from age but from years of cautious living and constant vigilance.

## Personality
Siaku is known for his insatiable curiosity and his unwavering honesty. His natural inquisitiveness often leads him to ask questions others might avoid, and his forthrightness has both earned him respect and gotten him into trouble. Despite the harsh circumstances, Siaku's spirits are surprisingly high. The shipwreck, a terrifying ordeal for many, has given him a strange sense of relief; he no longer has to face the prospect of returning to [[Balaika]]. Instead, he finds himself giddy at the unexpected turn of events, seeing the wreck as a bizarre form of liberation.

## Backstory
Siaku worked as a clerk in [[Balaika]] where he uncovered evidence that his supervisor was working with [[Veriduna]] to undermine the tributary relationship that [[Balaika]] has with the [[Pirate Confederacy]]. Siaku confronted the supervisor only to then be framed for the crime himself. Branded a traitor, he fled Balaika, and worked as a scribe for the following decade before the bounty hunter [[Luca Romano]] caught up with him.

## Unique Traits
Siaku has a distinct laugh, a hearty chuckle that's instantly recognizable and can lighten even the darkest of moments.

## Relationships
- **[[Luca Romano]]:** The bounty hunter who captured him. While their relationship is strained and complicated, there is a grudging respect between them. Siaku understands Luca's motivations, even if he resents her for his current predicament.
- **Other Castaways:** Siaku's curiosity and honesty make him a natural mediator among the castaways. His willingness to engage and his analytical mind can help the group make sense of their situation and plan their next steps.

## Potential Character Arc
Siaku's journey with the party offers opportunities for growth and redemption. Through their shared experiences, he may find a new purpose and a way to clear his name. Siaku's relationship with [[Luca Romano]] could evolve, moving from animosity to mutual respect and perhaps even alliance as they work together for survival.

Finding a way to clear his name would easily earn Siaku's friendship and getting him off of the island couldn't hurt either.
