## Appearance
Luca Romano is a striking half-elven woman in her late twenties. Her trim, athletic build reflects years of physical training and the demands of her rugged profession. Luca's short black hair is often tousled by the wind, and her piercing blue eyes seem to miss nothing. Her tan skin suggests a life spent mostly outdoors, under the sun. She is almost always seen wearing her tight-fitted leather armor and a tricorn hat, adding to her distinctive, somewhat roguish appearance. Luca prefers darker clothing, which complements her stealthy nature and gives her an air of mystery and intimidation.

## Personality
Luca Romano is driven by an intense desire to captain her own ship, a goal that defines much of her actions and motivations. She is indifferent to what kind of ship she commands; it could be a merchant vessel, a warship, or even a pirate ship. What matters to her is the freedom and authority that come with being a captain.

Luca has faced numerous challenges breaking into the field of commanding ships, often finding herself at odds with more established figures who doubt her abilities or are threatened by her ambition. This has left her with a chip on her shoulder and a somewhat cynical outlook.

Her interactions with others are often marked by a sharp tongue and a defensive demeanor. She mocks or even assaults those who make flirtatious overtures, viewing such interactions as distractions or signs of disrespect. Luca also struggles with anger and frustration, which she dulls with alcohol. This habit of drinking heavily is both a coping mechanism and a barrier, keeping others at a distance.

## Backstory
After failing to secure a ship of her own Luca turned her skills to tracking and capturing fugitives, in an attempt to secure the wealth and respect that she needs to one day buy her own ship.

[[Siaku Dolrino]], a clerk who uncovered a dangerous conspiracy and was subsequently framed, is her most recent bounty. The capture was meant to be straightforward, but the events leading to their current predicament have thrown everything into chaos.

During the voyage on [[The Evangeline]], Luca spent most of her time in self-imposed isolation in her cabin. She avoided mingling with the other passengers and crew, preferring solitude over company. When not passed out from drinking, she was half-drunk and indulging in her secret passion: poetry. Luca's poetry is raw and emotional, revealing a softer, more introspective side that she rarely shows to the world.


## Potential Character Arc: 
Luca's journey with the party could lead to significant personal growth. Through the shared hardships of their predicament, she might learn to trust others and open up about her dreams and struggles. Her ambition to captain a ship could be a driving force in the group's quest for survival and eventual escape. Luca's development could see her moving from a solitary, embittered figure to a respected leader, earning the loyalty and friendship of those around her.

Retrieving the [[Prick Berries]] to help assuage her alcoholism would win her friendship and presenting her with a ship of any kind would be sure to win her undying loyalty.
