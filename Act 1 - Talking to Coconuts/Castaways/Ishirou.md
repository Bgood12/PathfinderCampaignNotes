## Appearance
Ishirou is a rugged looking human man who looks much older than he actually is on account of his greying hair and beard. He wears well-kept though obviously low quality armor and clothing. His katana, equally well kept, is much more valuable.

## Backstory
Ishirou grew up aboard his father's merchant vessel. During his many stops on land he witnessed the roots that people put down and got jealous. Fueled by jealous Ishirou set his father's ship on fire thinking that it would make his family put down roots. Ishirou's father died trying to put out the fire.
Distraught Ishirou stowed away on a ship of the [[Ekeko Consortium]]. Afterwords he did miscellaneous work for the consortium for 10 years. During that time he was gifted his katana as a means of making him view himself as further indebted with the group.
