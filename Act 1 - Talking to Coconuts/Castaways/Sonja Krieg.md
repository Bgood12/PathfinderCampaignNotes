## Appearance
Sonja Kreig is a striking human woman in her late twenties with tousled red hair that falls straight and wild around her face and shoulders. Her vivid green eyes gleam with a mix of mischief and intensity, revealing her insatiable curiosity and lust for adventure. Her slender athletic build speaks to her agility and combat prowess, honed through years of rigorous training. A prominent tattoo of a scorpion tail spiraling between her shoulder blades marks her affiliation with the [[Crimson Scorpions]], a notorious group. Her left pinky finger is missing, a constant reminder of her rebellious nature and the consequences of defying her powerful mother.

## Personality
Sonja's personality is marked by an almost manic optimism and a seemingly boundless capacity for laughter. Her moods swing rapidly, never lingering on anger or sadness for long, which often unnerves those around her. This combined with her thirst for violence and adventure only serves to exasperate the concerns of those around her. Her constant search for the next thrill and her disregard for personal safety frequently lead her into dangerous situations. Sonja's unpredictable nature and love for chaos make her a challenging companion, often leaving her isolated and lonely despite her vibrant personality.

## Backstory
Sonja Kreig was born into the [[Crimson Scorpions]], a group known for their ruthless efficiency and strict hierarchy. Her mother, a high-ranking member, had great expectations for Sonja. From a young age, Sonja displayed an innate talent for combat, her graceful movements and natural fighting instincts setting her apart from her peers. However, her insatiable curiosity and rebellious streak makes her rankle at orders and frequently brought her into conflict with authority figures.
She caused her mother a great many problems which led to her being sent to [[Balaika]] to aid in Crimson Scorpion interests in the region. While she wasn't officially exiled her mother swore that if Sonja ever returned, she would never leave again, and to drive home the severity of this threat, she took Sonja's left pinky finger.

## Potential Character Arc
Developing trust and meaningful connections with her companions can help Sonja transform from a lonely, thrill-seeking rebel into a loyal and respected ally.
