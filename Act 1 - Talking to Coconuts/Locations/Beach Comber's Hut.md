Nestled on the sandy shores of [[Cannibal Island]], the Beach Comber's Hut stands as a whimsical and eccentric structure. This charmingly chaotic abode is a patchwork of shipwreck debris, featuring multicolored umbrellas that provide a burst of vibrant color against the backdrop of the island's natural beauty. Mismatched furniture, scavenged from various sources, creates an eclectic and haphazard atmosphere within the hut.

A kobold named [[Jib]] lives in the beach comber's hut with several hermit crabs and mischievous jungle birds. Jib has gone insane from long term isolation.
