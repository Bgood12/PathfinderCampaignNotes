This 200 foot long causeway is only accessible at lowtide. From this distance the fungal nature of the nearby [[Fungus Island]] is unmistakable.


**Sensory**
- The causeway stretches out like a jagged spine, its rocks glistening with moisture from the receding tide.

**Hazards:**
- **Treacherous Terrain:** The uneven and slippery nature of the causeway requires careful navigation. Characters must succeed on a DC 12 Acrobatics check to avoid slipping and falling into the shallow, yet rocky waters below. Failure results in 1d6 bludgeoning damage from the fall and exposure to the sharp rocks.
- **Tidal Timing:** The causeway is only accessible at low tide. Characters must time their crossing carefully, as lingering too long can result in being stranded on the wrong side or swept away by the incoming tide. A DC 10 Survival check can help determine the safe window for crossing.
