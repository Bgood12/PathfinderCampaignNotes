The party may be lead to this location by the specter of [[Captain Perry Kieran]] has he walks along the coast.

What remains of this crumbling ship has been wedged between jagged rocks along the isle's coast. The remains of the vessel, broken and battered by the relentless sea, rise eerily from the surf, their splintered timbers casting long shadows in the moonlight. The skeleton of the ship creaks with the movement of the waves. 

**Sensory**
- The ship's tattered sails flutter like ghostly wails. 
- The ship's deck is cluttered with debris, a mix of rotted wood, rusted metal, and remnants of cargo long since ruined.
- The air is thick with the salty tang of the sea, mingled with the musty scent of decayed wood and algae.

Most of the loot of the ship has either been taken or rotted away, however, a search of the captain's cabin reveals a skeleton clutching a coffer that was hidden in a secret compartment in the floor. *DC 17* strength or thievery check to open the locked coffer.

#### Loot
The locked coffer contains:
- A +1 potency dagger
- A golden locket worth 50gp containing an extremely detailed portrait of a blonde haired elven woman. Text at the bottom of the portrait identifies this woman as 'Elincia'.
- A ledger detailing the collusion between [[Captain Perry Kieran]] and several mid-level administrators in the [[Balaika]] government. This journal is enough to clear [[Siaku Dolrino]]'s name.
