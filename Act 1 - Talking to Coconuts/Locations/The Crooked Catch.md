The party may be lead to this location by the specter of [[Captain Perry Kieran]] has he walks along the coast.

What remains of this ship has been wedged between jagged rocks along the coast of the isle. Most of the loot of the ship has either been taken or rotted away, however, a search of the captain's cabin reveals a skeleton clutching a coffer that was hidden in a secret compartment in the floor. *DC 17* strength or thievery check to open the locked coffer.

#### Loot
The locked coffer contains:
- A +1 potency dagger
- A golden locket worth 50gp containing an extremely detailed portrait of a blonde haired elven woman. Text at the bottom of the portrait identifies this woman as 'Elincia'.
- A ledger detailing the collusion between [[Captain Perry Kieran]] and several mid-level administrators in the [[Balaika]] government. This journal is enough to clear [[Siaku Dolrino]]'s name.
