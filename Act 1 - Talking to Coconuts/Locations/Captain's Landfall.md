This thin strip of sandy beach stands in contrast to the rocky coastlines and dense jungles of the island. This serene stretch of land is where [[Captain Oakley]] and [[Irena]] made landfall. The beach itself is made up of fine, white sand and scattered sea shells. Well above the high tide line is evidence of a small campfire with quick simple shelters made from palm fronds and driftwood. Some refuse near the campsite includes the captain's tricorn hat and a scarf belonging to [[Irena]].

DC 15 Survival check to find and follow tracks to the trail.
DC 20 survival check to determine that the tracks turn inland at that point.
