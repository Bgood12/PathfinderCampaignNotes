Each trap except for the one at the [[Cannibal Ambush]] is identical. There is a cleverly hidden vine across the path that the cannibals use to traverse the island. When triggered a target is pulled 10 feet up a nearby tree into a pair of sharpened stakes each dealing 2d8 piercing damage on a DC 17 Reflex Save.

*DC 22* check to free self from the snare
- Alternatively the vine can be cut with a slashing weapon
