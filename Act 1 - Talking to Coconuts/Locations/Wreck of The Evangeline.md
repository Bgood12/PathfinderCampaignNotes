Once below decks a frenzied scratching can be heard from the eurypterid attempting to get into the storeroom where [[the first mate]] died.

#### Description 
The stern of the ship is all that has survived of [[The Evangeline]]. It should only be a matter of time before the constant crashing of the wave dislodges the ship from the collection of jagged rocks that it finds itself on. 
The bow of the lifeboat remains moored to the ship, the rest evidently was smashed to splinters against the rocks.

*DC 10 Perception check* Notes that the lower decks are missing as well as the bow.

#### Encounter
With the odd angle of the ship and the repeated crashing of the waves movement on the ship is considered difficult terrain.

There is one elite eurypterid in this encounter.
