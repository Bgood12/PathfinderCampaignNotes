The massive 20 foot tall stone doors to Besmara's Temple are initially submerged beneath the water in the neighboring bay. These doors are covered by a sheet of green seaweed which obscures carvings of [[Besmara]]. If the [[Tide Stones]] have recently been activated these doors will stand open.

### Entryway
Inside the doors is a 40 foot high room held in place by eight pillars, four on each side. Across from the entrance in the right alcove is a lever that opens the large stone doors leading to this area. In the left alcove is a concealed hole that drops 20 feet into the **Doll Room**.

### Sanctum
The sanctum, the large room in the middle of the map, has a skeletal archer on each balcony overlooking this room. In addition this room has several murals dedicated to [[Besmara]]. These murals with study reveal the true nature of the temple; the resting place of the first pirate king [[The First Pirate King]].

After the long narrow hallway there is a 'T' intersection. The right path leads to the sleeping quarters of the temples workers.

To the left of the 'T' intersection there are a a pair of false floor traps. At the intersection of each hallway, the hallways aren't actually there and instead represent the 20ft fall to the room below, is a 10ft section of floor with a crease in the middle that drops down from the left and right walls on hinges when any weight is placed upon the trap's area.

### Pit Traps
The pit traps are connected to the **Doll Room** by a series of 1ft diameter carved tubes. If noise is caused by the traps the dolls move to defend the temple.

### Blade Trap
The ceiling of this room is decorated with crisscrossing supports and grooves. There are more murals of [[Besmara]] on the walls here. These are here to delay would-be sleuths into triggering the blade trap. 
15 seconds after entering the room after the pit traps a heavy brass wall will drop blocking each entryway to the room and blades will swing from groves in the ceiling. The trap can be prevented by pressing a button in the room before the trap springs. Faint magic radiates from the button and the grooves if a PC has an ability that lets them detect it.

### Tomb of [[The First Pirate King]]
Standing between the stairs is a beautifully carved 15ft tall statue of Besmara. On the dais behind the statue is [[The First Pirate King]]'s coffin and final resting place. [[Irena]] studies the markings on the wall, which depict the fall of [[The First Pirate King]], while [[Rubrack the Red]] stands guard.
Once defeated an intellect devourer bursts from [[Irena]]'s skull and attempts to scurry away; the true mastermind of her plot.

#### Loot
[[Irena]] carries 18gp on her person as well as a spell casting focus. 
1 of the [[Pieces of Eight]] is in the coffin with [[The First Pirate King]].
