There are a few huts here made out of wood with roofs made of palm fronds. The tree stump in front of the main structure is a wooden grate with a rope coil next to it.

This room has several articles of paraphernalia salvaged from the wreck of The Voyager (S17). The centerpiece is the masthead that was taken from the ship shortly after its wreck. A DC20 Society check reveals that these items date back to the earliest days of House [[Kasa]]'s rule over [[Veriduna]].

Area 12: Rubrack's Den
A 20 foot stairwell leads to this room which takes the entire floor. [[Rubrack the Red]] along with his four consorts can be found here at any time of the day. The room is decorated with dilapidated furniture taken from The Voyager's wreck (S17). A dented footlocker against one wall contains the ship's payroll, kept more out of nostalgia than anything else. If [[Irena]] has already left she will have traded her minion in [[Captain Oakley]] for Rubrack depositing Oakley in the caves beneath the camp.
