This grassy knoll is one of the few areas on the island that's not overgrown with jungle. The grass here is lush and green, swaying gently in the breeze, giving the impression of a peaceful meadow.

**Sensory**
- There's a gentle rustling of grass and the sound of crashing waves at sea form a calming backdrop. An occasional seabird flies overhead.
- The grass is soft and cool (if anyone's barefoot)

The treasure placed here were the spoils of one Claxton Eastoft who sought to conceal his ill-gotten gains until those he stole it from were long dead. Unfortunately for him shortly after leaving the island he was captured by privateers. His belongings, including his treasure map, were stolen and he was executed.

Given that the map features a rather good drawing of the coast line of an unnamed island it was of little use to anyone and passed between many hands until reaching [[Tatsu]]'s. 

The map indicates that at sunrise stand at the top of the hill where the sun comes between the two rock formation at sea and dig in that spot.

At that spot digging 10 feet down will bring the PCs to a wooden plug and the skeletal remains of a halfling.
- *DC 20 Medicine* - The hole in the back of the halfling's leather armor and the groves between two of his ribs indicate that he was stabbed through the heart with a dagger from behind.

#### Shaft Design
- Below the wooden plug is a 40 foot shaft followed by 10 feet of murky water. Breaking the plug will deal 2d8 damage to anything in the shaft below.
- At this depth of the plug the shaft is dug through clay and is much harder to dig out.
- There are wooden supports lining the shaft below the plug.
- Climbing up or down using these is easy requiring a DC 10 athletics check.
- The water at the bottom of the shaft is from the water table.
- The shaft is a 'J' shape climbing out of the water on the other side.

There are 3 lacedons (aquatic ghouls) hiding in the murky water that haven't eaten for decades.

#### Treasure
At the other end of the 'J' shaped shaft lies a waterproof and airtight chest (DC 28 thievery to open with tools). Finding and sharing this treasure with [[Tatsu]] completes his loyalty quest.
