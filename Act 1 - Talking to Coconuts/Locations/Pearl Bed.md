The jungle comes to an abrupt stop at the edge of this expansive bay, where the dense foliage gives way to a steep, 50 feet a cliff. The cliff face is dotted with several ropes and vines that dangle precariously over the edge, suggesting that others have used this route to descend to the bay below. The bay's calm, turquoise waters create a picturesque scene with the relatively calm waters of the bay.

The water is much calmer in this bay than elsewhere around the island requiring only a DC 15 athletics check to swim. A simple DC8 athletics check is required to climb down the cliff face.

The cannibals are overzealous in harvesting these pearls and only 10 still are present in the bay. Each pearl is worth 1d4 x 5gp.

*DC 30 Perception check* - Find a pearl with a day of searching
- Can be lowered by critical swim checks
