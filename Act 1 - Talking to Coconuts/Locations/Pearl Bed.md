The jungle comes to an abrupt stop at the edge of this expansive bay 50 feet up a cliff. Several ropes and vines hang over the cliff face. 

The water is much calmer in this bay than elsewhere around the island requiring only a DC 15 athletics check to swim. 

The cannibals are overzealous in harvesting these pearls and only 10 still are present in the bay. Each pearl is worth 1d4 x 5gp.

*DC 30 Perception check* - Find a pearl with a day of searching
- Can be lowered by critical swim checks
