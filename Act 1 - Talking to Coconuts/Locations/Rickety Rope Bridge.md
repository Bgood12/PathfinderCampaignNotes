A rickety looking rope bridge spans a 50 foot gorge with a swiftly flowing river. The bridge is made of weathered, fraying ropes and old, uneven wooden planks. Several planks hve fallen and others are barely hanging on. Each step on the bridge causes it to sway and creak ominously. If more than one medium creature is on the bridge it creaks ominously if the weight is not removed in 1d4 rounds the bridge collapses into the shallow frothy river 30 feet below.

**Other Sensory**
- Roar of the river below
- The ropes are rough and splintery, and the wooden planks are uneven and worn smooth by countless feet. The entire structure feels unstable and precarious.
