#### Camp 2 - Driftwood
Several small structures made of palm fronds and driftwood.
There are sabers and daggers scattered around the area.

*DC 20 Perception* - A dagger with a +1 potency rune in a leather scabbard poking out from under pile of driftwood. The rune is stylized to look like a scorpion tail in a spiral. This is the symbol of the [[Crimson Scorpions]], it's also the symbol tattooed between [[Sasha Kafer]]'s shoulder blades.

#### Camp 3 (Shipname here)
This is the most developed as it look the cannibals the longest to find. There is a completed wooden shack with 100s of teeth hammered into one of its walls - a symbol of the cannibal's victory after a particularly tough fight.

#### At any campsite
*DC 12 Perception* - Notices old bloodstains and other signs of violence.
If the PCs spend a night here there is a 50% chance that a cannibal patrol happens by. Shipwreck survivors do like easy shelter after all.
