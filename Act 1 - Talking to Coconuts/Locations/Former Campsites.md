#### Camp 1 - Floating Hippo
There are several small shelters made out of driftwood, most of them are partially collapsed.
The scent of the sea lingering on the air and the nearby palm fronds add a strange sense of serenity to the campsite. The collapsed shelters contain simple personal belongings; tattered clothing broken bottles and the like.

#### Camp 2 - Driftwood
Several small structures made of palm fronds and driftwood.
There are sabers and daggers scattered around the area. These weapons have been worn and weathered by exposure to the elements. All show at least a noteworthy amount of rust.

*DC 20 Perception* - A dagger with a +1 potency rune in a leather scabbard poking out from under pile of driftwood. The rune is stylized to look like a scorpion tail in a spiral. This is the symbol of the [[Crimson Scorpions]], it's also the symbol tattooed between [[Sonja Krieg]]'s shoulder blades.

#### Camp 3 - Tsunami
This is the most developed as it look the cannibals the longest to find. There is a completed wooden shack with 100s of teeth hammered into one of its walls - a symbol of the cannibal's victory after a particularly tough fight.

#### At any campsite
*DC 12 Perception* - Notices old bloodstains and other signs of violence.
If the PCs spend a night here there is a 50% chance that a cannibal patrol happens by. Shipwreck survivors do like easy shelter after all.
