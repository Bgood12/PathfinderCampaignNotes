The massive 20 foot tall stone doors to the Zirnitran Outpost are initially submerged beneath the water in the neighboring bay. These doors are covered by a sheet of green seaweed which obscures carvings of a large serpentine dragon reminiscent of Shenron. If the [[Tide Stones]] have recently been activated these doors will stand open.
