The massive 20 foot tall stone doors to the Zirnitran Outpost are initially submerged beneath the water in the neighboring bay. These doors are covered by a sheet of green seaweed which obscures carvings of a large serpentine dragon reminiscent of Shenron. If the [[Tide Stones]] have recently been activated these doors will stand open. 
The outpost, once revealed, is a mix of ancient grandeur and ruin, with cracked walls and missing chunks. There are loose stones and debris scattered throughout the outpost and the rough rocky surfaces are cold and damp to the touch.
### Entryway
Inside the doors is a 40 foot high room held in place by eight pillars, four on each side. Across from the entrance in the right alcove is a lever that opens the large stone doors leading to this area. 

### Sanctum
The sanctum, the large room in the middle of the map, has a skeletal archer on each balcony overlooking this room. In addition this room has hundreds of runes. The runes are difficult to translate due to the missing chunks from the wall, several large cracks disrupting them, and the ancient scribes pension for metaphor.

- The ancient people made use of undead slaves
- They seem to dislike their own kind specifically Zirnitria - Leaklan would know that this is an ancient city known to be in [[Zelvahar]].

After the long narrow hallway there is a 'T' intersection. The right path leads to the sleeping quarters of the temples workers; as well as the athenaeum. This part of the structure has long since collapsed.

To the left of the 'T' intersection there are a a pair of false floor traps. At the intersection of each hallway, the hallways aren't actually there and instead represent the 20ft fall to the room below, is a 10ft section of floor with a crease in the middle that drops down from the left and right walls on hinges when any weight is placed upon the trap's area.

### Pit Traps
The pit traps are connected to the **Snake Pit** by a series of 1ft diameter carved tubes. If noise is caused by the traps the snakes move to defend the temple.

### Rubrack's Standoff
Rubrack was commanded to stand guard in the room at the base of the stairs. Rubrack earned his nickname by drenching himself in his opponents blood.

### Alter
Standing between the stairs is a beautifully carved 15ft tall statue of an ophidian humanoid. This statue is made of dark polished stone with scales that seem to glisten in the dim light. It's eyes are voids of obsidian. The staue lacks eyelids and has a sharp angular jawline. 
On the dais behind the statue an alter which the vishkanya used to exert control over their undead minions. Breaking this alter will destroy any undead on the island as well as lifting the mist and any other supernatural effects.

[[Irena]] has been studying the runes and murals on the walls of this outpost but mostly here in the innermost chamber. She believes that she is close to unveiling the location of the lost capital city of [[Zirnitra]]. She's content to explain her actions if the PCs have questions. She'd use the opportunity to attempt to charm a couple of them prior to the inevitable conflict.
