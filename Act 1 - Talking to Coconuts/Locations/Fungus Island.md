This island's monochromatic palette of dreary grey is immediately noticeable from a distance which stands out alongside the lush green of the main island's jungle. This island has many large mushrooms that resemble trees from a distance casting eerie shadows, and a dense undergrowth comprised of strands of lichen. This lichen is spongey and soft to the touch.


Several fungus creatures (Fungus Leshy statblock: https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=281) scour this island in pairs. There are generally three patrols at any given time. The leshys fight to the death and attempt to bring any unconscious characters to [[The Dark Tentacle]].


**Sensory Details:**
- **Sight:** The landscape is dominated by towering mushrooms with wide caps, their grey hues blending together to create a desolate and alien environment. The lichen on the ground glows faintly in the dim light. Eerie shadows dance across the landscape as the light filters through the mushroom caps.
- **Sound:** The island is unnervingly quiet, with only the occasional rustle of lichen or the soft, wet plop of fungal spores falling to the ground. The lack of typical forest sounds, such as birdsong or rustling leaves, creates an unsettling silence.
- **Smell:** The air is thick with the musty, earthy scent of fungi and decay. There is a subtle sweetness to the smell, reminiscent of rotting fruit, mixed with the dampness of the lichen.
- **Touch:** The lichen underfoot is spongey and soft, giving way slightly with each step. The mushrooms are cold and slick to the touch, their surfaces covered in a fine layer of moisture. The air feels humid and heavy, clinging to the skin.
