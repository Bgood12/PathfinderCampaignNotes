This island is a dreary grey which stands out alongside the lush green of the main island's jungle. This island has many large mushrooms that resemble trees from a distance and a dense undergrowth comprised of strands of lichen.


Several fungus creatures (Fungus Leshy statblock: https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=281) scour this island in pairs. There are generally three patrols at any given time. The leshys fight to the death and attempt to bring any unconscious characters to [[The Dark Tentacle]].
