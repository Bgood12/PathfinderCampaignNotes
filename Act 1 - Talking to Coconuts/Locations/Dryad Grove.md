The grove exudes an aura of tranquility, untouched by the chaos and danger that permeates most of the island.
There is a towering 60ft oak tree in the center of this grove. This tree is the home of [[Foínikas]]. 
- The ancient branches of the oak tree spread wide and create a natural canopy that filters sunlight into a dappled pattern.
- The lush vegetation surrounding the tree is vibrant and healthy, with various plants and flowers in full bloom.
The cannibals avoid this area because they believe it processed by an evil spirit. As a result [[Foínikas]] hasn't had conversation with an intelligent creature in a very long time. 

If the PCs arrive here she will approach smiling and in a non threatening manner.


## Hot Springs
The hot springs located in the dryad's grove are serene and picturesque with steam rising from the inviting turquoise waters, surrounded by lush vegetation.
- The air of the grove smells of blooming flowers and mineral rich steam.

The hot springs has some healing properties. Spending an 8 hour long rest in them counts as a 24 hour rest.
