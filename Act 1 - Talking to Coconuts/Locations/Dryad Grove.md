There is a towering 60ft oak tree in the center of this grove. This tree is the home of [[Foínikas]]. 

The cannibals avoid this area because they believe it processed by an evil spirit. As a result [[Foínikas]] hasn't had conversation with an intelligent creature in a very long time.

If the PCs arrive here she will approach smiling and in a non threatening manner.
