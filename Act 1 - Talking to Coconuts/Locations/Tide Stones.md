The tide stones are a set of magical stones placed hear by [[The Second Pirate King]], to ensure that none would ever find the temple in which had hidden [[The First Pirate King]]. The stones use a magic to raise the water level around the island along with roiling the tides. This reduces exploration to the island.

The stones can be activated in a way the makes narrative sense, for example pouring saltwater on the central rock formation from a metal container and reciting a common prayer to [[Besmara]].

When the tide stones are activated a loud thunderclap can be heard, though the volume of this sound pales in comparison to the sound of the water rushing out of the nearby bay. From the cliffs near the tide stones, once the water has been drained, one can also make out the massive, formerly submerged doors to the [[Pirate Queen's Temple]] screeching open.

This cacophony of sounds alerts and greatly angers the [[Displacer Beast]] that has its den nearby, and it comes out to attack. The beast attacked [[Irena]] as well when she activated the stones. She used her mind magics to calm the beast so that she could pass unscathed.
