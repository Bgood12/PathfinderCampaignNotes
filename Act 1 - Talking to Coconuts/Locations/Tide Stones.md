The tide stones are a set of magical stones placed here by the ancient society of [[Zirnitra]] to conceal their hidden outpost. The stones use a magic to raise the water level around the island along with roiling the tides. This reduces exploration to the island. The stones are arranged in a circular pattern, each engraved with intricate runes. The stones over look the nearby bay.

The stones can be activated in a way the makes narrative sense, for example placing or sacrificing a snake on the central altar. Once the party deciphers the origins of the stones.

When the tide stones are activated a loud thunderclap can be heard, though the volume of this sound pales in comparison to the sound of the water rushing out of the nearby bay. From the cliffs near the tide stones, once the water has been drained, one can also make out the massive, formerly submerged doors to the [[Zirnitran Outpost]] screeching open.

This cacophony of sounds alerts and greatly angers the [[Displacer Beast]] that has its den nearby, and it comes out to attack. The beast attacked [[Irena]] as well when she activated the stones. She used her mind magics to calm the beast so that she could pass unscathed.

If the [[Displacer Beast]] gets reduced to half of its hit points it retreats to its nest.

The [[Displacer Beast]] keeps a collection of treasures that it has collected in it's next. They are listed in the loot section below.

**Sensory Details:**
- **Sight:** The stones are covered in lichen and moss, their surfaces worn smooth by centuries of exposure to the elements. 
- **Sound:** When the stones are activated, a loud thunderclap reverberates through the air, followed by the deafening roar of water rushing out of the nearby bay.
- **Touch:** The stones are cold and slightly damp to the touch, with a rough, textured surface. The runes feel warmer and tingle slightly under the fingers.
