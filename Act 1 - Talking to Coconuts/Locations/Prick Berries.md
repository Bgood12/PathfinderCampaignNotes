There is a large grove of thorny vines on the river bank here with menacing 4 inch red needles whose eerie shadows dance across the ground. This tangled mass of vines and thorns stretch like a natural barricade, their sharp points glistening ominously in the dappled sunlight through the trees above.

Sensory: 
- The crimson needles stand out starkly against the dark green of the vines
- The wind rustling the vines produces an unsettling sound almost like whispering.
- A faintly sweet scent carried from the center of the thicket, in contrast to the earthy smell of damp soil in the surrounding jungle.

This patch of needles is 30 feet thick and counts as difficult terrain. The first time that a creature moves through the needles on a turn it must make a DC 12 Reflex saving throw or be pricked by a needle. Once pricked a creature must make a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or increase its sickened level by 1 for 24 hours as it develops a painful rash.

There are 12 rations worth of prick berries at the center of this needle patch. These small, dark berries hang in clusters, their deep red hues contrasting with the green vines. A special property of these berries are that they give a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws against disease. Collecting these berries and returning them to [[Luca Romano]] will complete her personal quest.
