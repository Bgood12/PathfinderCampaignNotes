There is a large grove of thorny vines on the river bank here with intimidating 4 inch red needles. 

This patch of needles is 30 feet thick and counts as difficult terrain. The first time that a creature moves through the needles on a turn it must make a DC 12 Reflex saving throw or be pricked by a needle. Once pricked a creature must make a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or increase its sickened level by 1 for 24 hours as it develops a painful rash.

There are 12 rations worth of prick berries at the center of this needle patch. A special property of these berries are that they give a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws against disease. Collecting these berries and returning them to [[Aris Ramondo]] will complete her personal quest.
