An overgrown winding jungle path leads to a partially overgrown and partially collapsed hut made from driftwood, fallen logs, canvas and large leaves. Bones and skulls decorate the hut and surrounding area; clearly enough to have been sourced from dozens of people. The cannibals view the hut as a kind of holy site, and perform upkeep of the exterior. The interior is in disrepair and only fragments of the old captains life remain. A chair made from a tree stump some scraps of fabric.

Once per year the cannibals dress up a prisoner in their old captain's clothes and consume them here.

A DC 15 medicine check can determine that the bones have marks from both teeth and stone knives.

#### Loot
A DC 15 perception check notices a notebook tucked into a niche in a wall. Though the book was once good quality the years have not been kind to its condition.

There are shreds of entries remaining.
- Notes that [[ship's Priestess]] is effective at warding off sickness.
- ...fine hunting on this isle...
- [[ship's Priestess]] has turned the crew against me...
- SOMETHING TO SPARK INTEREST IN OPTIONAL AREAS OF THE ISLAND
- The crew has been wandering around lately... been nearly a decade. Who knows what kind of beliefs [[ship's Priestess]] has been able to instill.
- ... threw a still alive man in a boiling pot...
- They offered me immortality but I know the corruption it requires
