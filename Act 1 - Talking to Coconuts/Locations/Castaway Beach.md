The party was poisoned during dinner on [[The Evangeline]] the night prior. *Roll Fortitude saving throws to determine the order the party awakens*. The character with the best save will awaken slowly with a numbing sensation and slowly subceeding darkness before a sharp prick to their foot jolts them awake. This prick comes from a hungry eurypterid. *This deals 1 damage*. 

The other party members along with the other four castaways are beginning to stir on the beach. The other party members naturally awaken at a rate of one per round unless they take damage or they are awakened some other way.

#### Description
This secluded cove leads into a wall of green marking the threshold of the dense tropical jungle at the beach's edge. Jagged rocks line each side of the cove, creating a natural barrier against the relentless crashing waves. The sand is pale, powdery, and warm underfoot. The air is filled with the scent of salt and seaweed. The sound of waves crashing and the distant calls of exotic birds from the jungle create a haunting yet serene atmosphere.

*DC 10 Perception check* Spots the mast of [[The Evangeline]] peeing over the rocks near the entrance to the cove.

#### Encounter
There are 4 Eurypterids in this encounter.

The party was poisoned the night before. Have them roll Constitution saving throws for initiative.

A quartet of aquatic predators resembling a blend of crustacean and arachnid have skittered onto the sand, their segmented shells shimmer with a faint iridescence. The bravest of the bunch gives an experimental sting to the party member first in initiative dealing one damage and snapping them awake.

The parties gear is stacked somewhat haphazardly in a 10x10 area of the beach.
- Characters are assumed to be wearing any armor that they have.
- It takes an action to recover a piece of gear from this pile. This triggers opportunity attacks.
