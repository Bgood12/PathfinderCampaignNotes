The party was poisoned during dinner on [[The Evangeline]] the night prior. *Roll Fortitude saving throws to determine the order the party awakens*. The character with the best save will awaken slowly with a numbing sensation and slowly subceeding darkness before a sharp prick to their foot jolts them awake. This prick comes from a hungry eurypterid. *This deals 1 damage*. 

The other party members along with the other five castaways are beginning to stir on the beach. The other party members naturally awaken at a rate of one per round unless they take damage or they are awakened some other way.

The party was poisoned the night before. Have them roll Constitution saving throws for initiative.

A quartet of aquatic predators resembling a blend of crustacean and arachnid have skittered onto the sand, their segmented shells shimmer with a faint iridescence. The bravest of the bunch gives an experimental sting to the party member first in initiative dealing one damage and snapping them awake.

The parties gear is stacked somewhat haphazardly in a 10x10 area of the beach.
- Characters are assumed to be wearing any armor that they have.
- It takes an action to recover a piece of gear from this pile. This triggers opportunity attacks.
