The Dark Tentacle is wedged between two sizable rocks off the coast of the [[Fungus Island]]. The vessel, once a proud ship, is now a grim shadow of its former self, covered entirely by a thick layer of grey fungus. Several strands of this fungus reach the mainland almost like grotesque, organic rope bridges. They grey growth on the ship pulsates subtley.

Unconscious characters are brought to the ship's galley where they are force fed fungus in an ill fated attempt to create more myconoids. If a character dies during this process they are thrown overboard.

A myceloid and two fungus leshys tend to hang out on the galley deck. They investigate strange sounds and fight to the death. They hope to capture characters to turn into more fungal creatures.

There is a fleshy orb in the captain's cabin accessible from the middle deck behind the galley. A burst from this orb is responsible for the crew's initial transformation and is currently fueling the spread of the fungus on this island. If this orb is destroyed all fungal creatures on the island die in 5 rounds; the fungus deteriorates from the island over the next few days; and within a year the jungle will have reclaimed this island.
