**Description:** 
The Caves of the Mother, a dark and eerie underground system, harbors the insidious influence of Nelizia, a twisted priestess who transforms the unfortunate into her pack of ghoulish minions. Nestled beneath Camp Cannibal, these caves are a breeding ground for the infected and a stronghold for the malevolent forces threatening the island.

##### Entryway
A wooden grate in [[Camp Cannibal]] opens to a 20 foot drop into the top of this area.

##### Turning Room
Proceeding down an incline to the next area brings you to the turning room. This is where those that [[Nelizia]] deems worthy are infected with ghoul fever. If they survive they join her pack.

[[Captain Oakley]] was deposited in the caves by [[Irena]]. He was infected with ghoul fever but after his escapades was too worn down to survive the condition. He spent his final moments scrawling a message in blood.

#### Central Cave
A single lacedon is in this room gnawing on bones. If alerted he with run down to the Ghoul Den to alert his fellows.

#### Ghoul Den
Three lacedons are here at any given time, four if the one from the central cave joins them. When combat begins they let out a screech. Which alerts [[Nelizia]]. She will come out of the water in 1d4 rounds.

[[Nelizia]] values persistence and offers the PCs eternal life - if they survive the fever that is. Anyone who refuses this offer is only good for food.

##### Turning Room
[[Captain Oakley]]'s message: He is guilty about the fate of his crew and ship. "Being enthralled by that witch [[Irena]] is no excuse for my weakness. Being deposited here is no less than the fate I deserve. I don't beg forgiveness but I despair that she lives still. If the one reading this is of kind soul seek out whatever I've become then her and end us both. She seemed to have interest in the mountain."
