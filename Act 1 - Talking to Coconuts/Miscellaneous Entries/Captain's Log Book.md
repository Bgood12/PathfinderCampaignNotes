Earlier entries, along with the first ~2/3 of entries for this voyage are about recording progress.
At the later parts of this journey the entries grow less common and start to gain a focus on one of the passengers specifically; a scholar named [[Irena]]. The captain bemoans his inability to catch her attention. Eventually the log entries shift ominously talking about crew members 'eyeing' his Irena. He thinks his first mate is in love with her, and wished that he would 'have an accident'.
The last entry in the journal indicates that the captain has changed course for [[Cannibal Island]] at Irena's request, in hopes that they can make a home on the remote island. He notes that the crew seem agitated by their new course, and that 'something may need to be done about them' before their suspicions get worse.
