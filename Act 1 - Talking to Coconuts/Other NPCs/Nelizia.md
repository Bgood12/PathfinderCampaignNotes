Nelizia was the priest aboard The Voyager (see [[Shipwrecks]]).

Shortly after the shipwreck; Nelizia stumbled into the caves under present day [[Camp Cannibal]]. There she was infected with ghoul fever by the lacedons; which caused her to turn into one herself. She used her influence among the shipwrecked survivors to get them on the path to cannibalism. She is content to reside in these same caves savoring the 'gifts' that 'her children' provide.
