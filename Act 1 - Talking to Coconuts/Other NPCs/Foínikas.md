Foínikas stands about 4 1/2 feet tall. She has vibrant green hair shaped like palm fronds and eyes the color of a tropical sunset. She lives in [[Dryad Grove]].

Foínikas knows a lot about the island though not how she herself came to be here. She remembers when the original colonists came nearly 70 years prior; and when the soon to be cannibals shipwrecked here about 20 years after that.

Foínikas senses the infection coming from [[Fungus Island]]. Even if she was brave enough to leave her grove for that long she fears what the infection would do to her. If the PCs clear this infection she offers to help the PCs however she is able, such as offering them safety in her grove, helping them with her magic however they need or giving them knowledge about the island's inhabitants.
