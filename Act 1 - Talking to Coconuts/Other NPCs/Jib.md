Jib is a kobold who lives in the [[Beach Comber's Hut]]. 


### Appearance
Jib wears a tricorn hat adorned with seashells. He wields a +1 Kalis.
Jib has a wiry frame and a twitchy demeanor which hints at the effect that long term isolation has had on his sanity. His eyes dart around with a mixture of paranoia and fascination, and his voice quivers as he speaks.

### Personality
Jib is initially unfriendly towards the party due to the particularly rough time he's had on the island. 
- If the PCs talk to him he'll remark that talking to real people is so much more rewarding than talking to the birds, crabs, and ghosts on the island.
- Jib doesn't fear the cannibals "What worry do I have of human cannibals? They eat humans! Though I'm sure I taste delicious..." - as he eyes his forearm.
- He's resistant to leave his hut though if the PCs express a desire to defeat the cannibals.
	- He hates them for killing his friends and leaving them no one to talk to.


### Information
- If asked about his kalis he will tearily mention how he was gifted it by his close friend and Captain Rayka Sahli of the Driftwood see [[Former Campsites | Camp 2]]. He will pet the saber and whisper about how it will bath in cannibal blood.
	- Jib was not actually friends with the captain who was a [[Crimson Scorpions]] assassin. He was kept onboard as entertainment for the crew. In his insanity he concocted a backstory for himself.
- At some point he will ask if the PCs are with the two other survivors that he saw recently.
	- He can give descriptions of [[Irena]] and [[Captain Oakley]]. He'll note that Irena was clearly in charge.
	- Jib did not interact with them, only witnessed.
