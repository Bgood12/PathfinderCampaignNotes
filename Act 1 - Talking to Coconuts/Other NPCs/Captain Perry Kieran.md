Captain Kieran wanders the coast of the Isle at night and may well wind up leading the party to [[The Crooked Catch]].  He seeks to lay eyes on his beloved Elincia again, he performed his misdeeds in an attempt to provide a life for them that he felt they deserved.

He senses the theft if his locket is removed from [[The Crooked Catch]] and will approach the party next time they camp, likely either rising out of their campfire or walking in from the shore.

He will attack only if attacked, if the locket gets damaged or if the party seems to not be understanding his request.
