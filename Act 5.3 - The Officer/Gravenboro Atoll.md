Crescent shaped chain of tiny palm-dotted islets wrapped around a shallow sapphire-blue lagoon. The beach is sparsely strewn with driftwood, wreckage from the Crestfall.

Shrubbery and palm trees grow in haphazard patches, crabs scuttle across the rocks and overhead seabirds cry out mournful songs.


**The Crew**
DC24 Perception to pick out smoke from the surviving crew's campfire.
- The crew  live rough and desperate on dwindling supplies
- The crew will be immediately hostile, but be unable to put up any real resistance to the PCs
	- Easy DC to calm nerves/see desperation and open talks
- The crew's first mate knows about the secret compartment with the journal.

*First mate Vessa Treen*: Gruff human woman, skeptical but practical
