The Crestfall lies a broken skeleton against the jagged reef. The ship listing to its side, it's masts snapped like brittle bones, now tangled with seaweed. Tattered sails drift underwater like ghostly banners. Its hull moans with every wave carrying mournfully across the water.

Seabirds circle the wreck hungrily.

There are sharp coral pieces pierceing the bilge, bodies both crewmen and sahuagin littering the deck.

The captains cabin in a mess of tossed furniture from the wreck, and everything of value has been stripped. 

**Loot**
There's a hidden compartment above the captains bed containing:
- [[Kaelen's Journal]]
- 400gp diamond
- 200gp emerald
- 400gp sapphire
