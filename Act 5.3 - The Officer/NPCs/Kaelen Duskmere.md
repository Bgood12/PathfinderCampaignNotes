Kaelen is a tall half-elven man. His jet black hair has streaks of silver, braided back from a weathered tan face marked with old scars. His sharp blue eyes still watchful. He wears his favored sturdy dark blue coat embroidered with a faded gold trim, practical breaches, and worn boots softened by the salty air. A sabre lays nearby.

**Personality**
Kaelen was calm, pragmatic, and deeply loyal to those under his command. Though outwardly reserved he fostered a fierce camaraderie amongst his crew.
