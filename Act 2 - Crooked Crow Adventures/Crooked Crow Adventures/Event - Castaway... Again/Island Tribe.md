This tribe begins neutral to the PCs. A hunting party may come across them while they're on [[Ebbclaw Isle]] and lead them back to the tribe.

If the PCs inquire about the ruins on the island the [[Tribal Leader]] will say that they can provide a token so that the ruin's guardian won't attack them, but will only do this if they become honorary members of the tribe; such as by slaying the island's apex predator. A quality perception check can reveal that the [[Tribal Leader]] is wearing a symbol of Gozreh carved into a piece of local softwood.
