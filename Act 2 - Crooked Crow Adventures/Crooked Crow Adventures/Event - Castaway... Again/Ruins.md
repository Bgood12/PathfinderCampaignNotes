This ruined monastery is overgrown with vines and moss, its crumbling stone walls and collapsing roof hit at its once held grandeur. The earth is damp and the smell of salt carries on the wind.
A cracked stone archway marks the main entrance to the monastery. 
There's a garden in the central chamber it's overrun with thorny red brambles. There's also a large tree.
