The Howling Gale flagship of Isolde Reefbane's fleet floats at the end of a simple pier in the sea cove connecting to the [[Ogre Base]].  The ship is massive and old, with tattered rigging and waterlogged boards that creak lightly. It is dark in here despite being in a sea cave as a result of the illusion spell that the Xoarian has blocking the entrance to the cave, which will dispel upon his death. 

### Cove
Dozens of pale decaying bodies of humans, sharks, fish, etc float in the stagnant waters of the cove in varying states of decomposition.

### The Howling Gale
The ship is massive and old, with tattered rigging and waterlogged boards that creak lightly. 


[[Captain Vanessa Lycander]] can be found on the deck either defeated, or in the midst of battle depending on how long the PCs took getting here. She wears a series of golden jeweled necklaces.
- If the PCs help she actually seems grateful
- She'll claim that the PCs were more competent than she expected so she stranded them with the intention to return and share the loot after being certain that they could betray her.
