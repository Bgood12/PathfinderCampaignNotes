Tiny Barren rock spire that rises out of the ocean.


As [[The Crooked Crow]] approaches the small islet a haunting melody echoes across the water.
- This song coerces those who hear it to row a boat out to her spire, then attempt to climb it

Crew members who fail the save against the harpy's song defend the harpy from attackers then try to reach her nest.
- Unfriendly or hostile crew members use lethal damage against PCs
- Indifferent crew members use non-lethal damage
- Friendly or helpful crew use grabs, trips, or disarms

The harpy attacks anyone who tries to prevent others from reaching her. She retreats to her nest if reduced to 30% hp. If the battle follows her to her nest she fights to the death.
