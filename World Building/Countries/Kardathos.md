Kardathos from "kardia" greek for heart and "athos" after Mount Athos.

### History
Kardathos has recently emerged from a brutal civil war that shook the foundations of its society. The conflict culminated in the death of the previous High King, Leofric Wystan, who was opposed by his own daughter, Meira Wystan. 
Meira emerged victorious, and ascended to the throne upon her father's death.

The scars of the civil war are still fresh, remnants of Leofric's regime still hold power throughout the empire. 

### Economy
Kardathos is rich in natural resources with the iron mines in its mountains, and the darkwood of its forests making up the backbone of its economy. Along the empire's coast vineyards provide grapes, olives, and wines that are sought across the known world.

The senatorial class in Kardathos is obsessed with opulence. They live in luxury spending lavishly on displays of wealth. As a result the empire's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair. Meanwhile, the underclass of Kardathos is impoverished under the weight of crushing taxes to support the lifestyle of the senatorial class. The elite uplift select figures, that show loyalty, to keep the underclass ever hopeful that they too can ascend into the senatorial class.
### Government
Kardathos is ruled by High Queen Meira Wystan. She is assisted by her reanimated brother Osric Wystan. The empire reels from its recent civil war, with many of Meira's enemies remaining in positions of power throughout the land.

The Kardathan government is famous for its Byzantine bureaucracy, a labyrinthine system where the senatorial class constantly battle for jurisdiction. The senatorial class often hold Byzantine titles each tied to specific offices and privileges, all jealously guarded. Kardathos is divided into several prefectures, which are further divided into duchies, counties, baronies, and fiefdoms. Assassinations, betrayal, and political maneuvering are common methods of advancement. Parcels of land change hands frequently via these same methods. The constant jockeying has created an atmosphere where greed, mistrust, and paranoia are common.

The genealogy of Kardathos' royalty is kept and updated by large numbers of scholars. Most of the nobility can trace their lines back to some king or emperor.


### Other
Despite it's internal chaos, Kardathos maintains a close eye on its neighbors through an extensive and elaborate spy network.
