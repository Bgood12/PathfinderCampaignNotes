## Economy
Sirocco is a trade based power. The bazaars in its largest cities are famous throughout the region. The #TODO raider/bandits that seized control of the region saw their initial economic strength through sale of slaves and cactus juice. As they came to power they diversified trade for the sake of stability. The only controlled export from the region are its guns, an invention which initially spread throughout Sirocco's dwarven clans. Artificers found in the regions mountains and cities remain the primary manufacturers of these weapons.

## Government
The raider/bandit gang that came to power in the Sirocco Territories have allowed near anarchic free trade throughout the nation which spreads to its exports as well. The few laws that the gang has implemented are enforced harshly. 

## Geography/Climate
Most of Sirocco's large cities sprung up as a result of the region's natural harbors. This helps to ease maritime trade. The nation also borders a large inland mountain range. These mountains shroud the region in a permanent rain shadow desert making the land dry for most of the year.
A handful of times throughout the year the prevailing wind shifts and blows in off of the ocean.  When colliding with the warm air of the region it creates strong thunderstorms. These storms fill endorheic basins throughout Sirocco. These basins are the primary source of water for most of the regions people and wildlife, and create oases in their immediate vicinity.

## Inhabitants
Sirocco sees little permanent migration as a result of its harsh conditions. The region's largest demographics are dwarvish and human. Several dwarven clans are scattered throughout the region's hills and mountains as well as underground. Humans are more scattered but are most often found in the coastal cities or around the region's many oases. Gnomes and halflings make up a noteworthy minority in the region, most of them can be found in the coastal cities.
