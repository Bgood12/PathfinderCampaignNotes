### Government
Jarnheim is a loose confederation of tribal monarchies clustered around the larger settlements. There is no central government. Each king holds absolute authority over their subjects and their domain. Kings commonly display the heads of large beasts they've killed in their throne rooms as symbols of prowess and legitimacy.

Conflicts between kingdoms are common but typically resolved through arbitration and weregilds rather than full-scale war. Thing-moots—assemblies where free men can voice grievances and settle disputes—are held seasonally. While kings have absolute authority, they ignore these assemblies at their peril, as a king without the respect of his warriors is quickly replaced.

Succession is not strictly hereditary. A king's son must prove himself worthy through deeds of strength and cunning, or risk being challenged by ambitious jarls or rival claimants.

### Geography
Jarnheim is a harsh northern region of taiga and shattered coastal isles reminiscent of the western Scottish coast. The land was carved by ancient glaciers, leaving rocky terrain, deep fjords, and treacherous coastlines. The region spends most of the year frozen beneath snow and is buffeted by rain and snow throughout the seasons. Wildlife is abundant—wolves, bears, seals, and massive elk roam the forests and coasts—but the rocky soil and cold climate make agriculture nearly impossible.

The coastline is critical to Jarnfolk survival. Fishing provides a major food source, and the fjords offer natural harbors for their longships. Inland settlements cluster around geothermal hot springs, which provide warmth and are often considered sacred sites.

### History
Jarnheim was once united under the First Herskir, a legendary warrior-king who conquered the fractured kingdoms and brought them under a single banner. The lands fractured shortly after his death when his sons warred over succession, and the realm has not been truly unified since. Many kings claim descent from the First Herskir, using this lineage to legitimize their rule.

### Economy
Jarnheim's economy was historically based on raiding southern settlements for wealth, goods, and thralls. As lands to the south became more populated and better defended, most Jarnfolk shifted from raiding to commerce, seeking trade partnerships instead of conquest. They trade furs, amber, walrus ivory, and skilled mercenary services for food, metals, and luxuries they cannot grow or manufacture themselves. Agriculture plays no significant role in the economy. Opportunistic raids still occur when circumstances permit.

Jarnfolk longships are prized for their speed and maneuverability. Shipwrights are highly respected, and a well-built ship can be a family's most valuable asset. Some Jarnfolk serve as merchants, others as hired swords, and some kings rent out their warriors as mercenaries to foreign powers.

Some fiefdoms view the shift to trade as disrespectful and retain a preference for raiding over trade. 

### Culture
Jarnfolk culture values strength, cunning, and personal glory. A warrior's reputation is their most valuable possession, and tales of great deeds are passed down through skaldic poetry and song. Skalds hold an honored position in society, as they preserve history and a warrior's legacy.

Feasts and drinking halls are central to social life. Kings and jarls hold feasts to reward loyal warriors, forge alliances, and display their wealth. Boasting of one's deeds—and backing up those boasts—is expected. Insults to one's honor demand satisfaction, either through duel or weregild.

The Jarnfolk practice ritual combat and animal sacrifice to honor their gods. Warriors who die in battle are believed to feast in the halls of the gods, while those who die of sickness or old age face a lesser afterlife. This belief makes Jarnfolk fearsome in combat, as many seek a glorious death over a long life.

Tattoos and runic carvings are common. Warriors mark themselves with symbols of their deeds, clan affiliations, or divine protection. Rune-carvers who can inscribe weapons and armor with protective wards are sought after.

Thralldom—slavery—is practiced in Jarnheim, though less commonly than in the past. Thralls are typically captives from raids or those who cannot pay their debts. A thrall can earn or buy their freedom, and their children are born free.

### Military
Jarnfolk warfare revolves around fast, mobile raids using their longships. Warriors fight as individuals seeking personal glory rather than as disciplined formations. They favor axes, spears, and round shields, with wealthier warriors wearing chainmail. Berserkers—warriors who fight in trance-like fury—are feared across the known world.

On land, Jarnfolk excel at ambushes and guerrilla tactics in forested and mountainous terrain. They rarely field large armies, as kings struggle to maintain the loyalty of warriors outside of active campaigning or raiding seasons.

### Inhabitants
The region is primarily populated by the Jarnfolk, a hardy people adapted to the harsh climate. Minorities include nomadic human tribes, hardy dwarves, and gnomes. The Jarnfolk prefer deities with ties to battle or nature.

The region is primarily populated by the Jarnfolk, a hardy people adapted to the harsh climate. Minorities include nomadic human tribes, hardy dwarves who mine the mountains for iron and precious metals, and gnomes who live in geothermal settlements. The dwarven clans often trade metalwork to Jarnfolk kings in exchange for protection and goods.

The Jarnfolk prefer deities with ties to battle, nature, the sea, and winter. Many make offerings before raids, voyages, or hunts.

### Major Settlements
- **Iskholm**: The largest settlement and a major trading port. Neutral ground where kings meet for Thing-moots. Known for its massive longhouse capable of hosting hundreds.
- **Vargstead**: A fortress-settlement built into a mountainside, home to one of the most powerful "old way" kings who still prefers raiding to trade.
- **Galdrhaven**: A coastal settlement known for its rune-carvers and skalds. Considered sacred due to nearby hot springs.
