< named after the goddess of safety and salvation, deliverance, and preservation from harm (so-teer-ee-uh) >

Sotiría is located in a remote part of the ocean, hidden from the major currents
and common trade routes. This strategic isolation has allowed the Thalikó to
remain undisturbed as they rebuild their community. Sotiría was built in an
underwater volcanic caldera, forming a natural barrier against intrusions. Inside
the caldera are gardens of bioluminescent flora that provide both light and
sustenance. These gardens feature glowing kelp forests and phosphorescent
sea anemones. At the heart of Sotiría are geothermal crystal springs that provide
mineral-rich waters essential for the Thalikó’s agriculture and well-being.


#### **Sotiría’s Architecture**
Sotiría’s architecture reflects both its strategic positioning and its cultural
heritage –

<u>Reef Fortresses:</u> The structures within the city are built into the natural coral
formations and volcanic rock. These buildings are reinforced with enchanted
coral and protective wards to shield against potential threats. They are intricately
designed with flowing, organic shapes that blend seamlessly into the
environment.
<u>Camouflaged Entrances:</u> The entrances to the city are concealed by illusions and
natural coral growths, making them nearly impossible to find by those who are
not specifically guided. These camouflaged entrances are designed to look like
ordinary parts of the reef to unwitting passersby.
<u>Underwater Sanctuaries:</u> The Thalikó have created tranquil sanctuaries within
the crystal springs where they conduct ceremonies and meditate. These spaces
are adorned with luminous minerals and enchanted crystals that enhance their
calming properties.


#### **Sotiría’s Community and Culture**
The Thalikó have adapted and thrived despite their small numbers as they
learned to overcome the challenges of their new environment over time –

<u>Adaptive Magic:</u> The Thalikó use adaptive hydromancy to manipulate their
surroundings for protection and sustenance. They employ magic to maintain the
camouflaged appearance of their city, control the temperature of the geothermal
crystal springs, and encourage the growth of their bioluminescent gardens.
<u>Resilient Agriculture:</u> The Thalikó have developed advanced underwater farming
techniques. They use a combination of magic and aquaculture to cultivate crops
of enchanted sea plants and raise marine creatures, most notably hippocampi, in
carefully controlled environments.
<u>Strong Social Bonds:</u> The community is tightly knit with a strong emphasis on
cooperation and mutual support. The small population fosters close relationships
and a collective sense of purpose. Each member of the community has a role in
maintaining and protecting their hidden sanctuary.
<u>Cultural Rebirth:</u> The Thalikó have embraced their new beginnings by celebrating
their culture through traditional rituals and festivals. These celebrations often
involve intricate dances, storytelling, and the creation of vibrant art using the
bioluminescent flora.
<u>Knowledge Preservation:</u> The Thalikó have meticulously preserved their
knowledge and history. They maintain a hidden library within a crystal cave,
containing ancient scrolls and artifacts that hold the history and wisdom of their
people. The items in their collection were either saved amidst the initial turmoil by
the community’s librarians and scholars or sought out years later by brave
gatherers.
