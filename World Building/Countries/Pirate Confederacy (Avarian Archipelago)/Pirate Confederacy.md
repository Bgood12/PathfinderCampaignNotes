### Government
The confederacy operates under a loose yet effective leadership structure. The Pirate Council, composed of influential pirate captains, convenes periodically to discuss matters of common interest, resolve disputes, and plan strategic raids. However, ultimate authority rests with the [[Pirate King - Vorgash Thrask]], a position earned through notoriety, prowess, and usually killing your predecessor.

### Economy:
The pirate confederacy thrives on plunder and trade. Raiding merchant vessels, coastal towns, and rival pirate crews, they amass wealth in gold, jewels, and valuable artifacts. Stolen goods are traded within the Haven or sold discreetly in ports by underworld contacts. Black markets in the confederacy facilitate trade, allowing pirates to acquire specialized gear and information.

### Inhabitants and Diversity: 
The Confederacy is a melting pot of seafarers, from seasoned buccaneers to reformed ex-naval officers. The confederacy includes various pirate crews, each with unique specialties and backgrounds. This diversity adds to the confederacy's resilience and resourcefulness.


### History
In a bid to retain its independence the former colony of [[Balaika]] made a deal with [[The First Pirate King]]. The deal was a long term tributary agreement where the confederacy would defend [[Balaika]] by sea. The deal allowed [[The First Pirate King]] to exert an amount of influence and control over the new confederacy. The tribute has allowed the various pirate kings since to hold some degree of cohesion among the confederacies isles.
