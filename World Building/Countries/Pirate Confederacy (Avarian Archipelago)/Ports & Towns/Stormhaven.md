Stormhaven is the largest and most notorious port in the Pirate Confederacy. Its reputation as a haven for rogues, scoundrels, and freebooters is well-earned, but it’s also a city of opportunity, where merchants and adventurers can find riches and danger in equal measure. Despite its chaotic nature, Stormhaven is surprisingly organized, with unwritten rules and traditions that keep its myriad factions from turning the streets into a constant battlefield.
As it's largest city Stormhaven is the defacto capitol of the [[Pirate Confederacy]].

#### Layout & Geography
The settlement’s walls are high and formidable, and its fortress, perched on the tallest cliff overlooking the harbor, boasts powerful ballistae and trebuchets capable of keeping enemy fleets at bay.

The harbor itself is deep and wide, with enough space to accommodate dozens of large, heavily laden vessels. The docks are chaotic but efficient, with smaller craft darting between moored ships to ferry goods, passengers, and supplies.

#### Economy
Stormhaven’s economy thrives on piracy, smuggling, and trade. Ships laden with stolen goods arrive daily, their cargo sold in the **Bazaar of the Damned** or to local merchants. The port has become a hub for rare and exotic items unavailable elsewhere, attracting daring merchants willing to risk dealing with the pirate elite.
