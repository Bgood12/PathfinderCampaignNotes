AKA: Sylro Enallyna
Ship: Zephyr's Gambit

#### Appearance
Sylro stands lean and wiry with long dark hair. His eyes gleam like storm lit clouds. He wears a billowing longcoat, dark as an oncoming squall, fastened only by a thick belt of braided rope. Beneath it, he wears layered leathers, reinforced with bone-carved fastenings - remnants of creatures felled by his own hands. His boots are soft-soled allowing him to feel the sway of the deck beneath him, his balance unnervingly perfect even in the roughest of storms.

#### Personality
Sylro is a force of nature in both word and deed. He is arrogant, free-spirited, and utterly untamed carrying himself with the self-assuredness of someone who has survived countless tempests—both literal and metaphorical. He speaks with a charismatic lilt, his words carrying the weight of someone who lives by his own code.

However, beneath the wind-tossed bravado, Sylro carries the weight of unspoken regrets. His decision to leave his family and his druidic circle was not made lightly, yet he refuses to dwell on the past, dismissing sentimentality as weakness. He rarely speaks of [[Yllavyre Enallyna|Ylla]], but when he does, there is a lingering flicker of something - guilt? Longing? - quickly buried beneath a smirk and a dismissive wave of his hand.

#### Backstory
Sylro is the brother of [[Yllavyre Enallyna|Ylla]]. After leaving the Plains Keeper druids on bad terms he set out to find his own path. 

After leaving, Sylro might wandered the continent. He worked as a mercenary, caravan guard, and as a smuggler, using his storm-honed survival skills to navigate treacherous terrain and escape those who saw him as an outsider.

One fateful night, he fell in with a group of privateers operating along the coast. They needed someone who could read the weather, predict storms, and guide their ship through dangerous waters. Sylro, who had spent his childhood  feeling the pulse of the wind, fit the role perfectly. He became a navigator and eventually, a proper sailor.

While working aboard a ship, Sylro's crew attempted to outrun a storm, underestimating his warnings. The ship wrecked and he barely survived, washing up on in a pirate-controlled port. There, he was forced to adapt fast, using his knowledge of wind and wave to ingratiate himself with local captains. Over time, he came to  embrace piracy as a means of freedom, carving out a reputation as someone who could sail where others wouldn't dare. 

Sylro, now a seasoned sailor, entered The Maelstrom Regatta. His first run was pure survival, narrowly skirting death, using his druidic instincts to read the hurricane's chaotic patterns.

But in subsequent years, he refined his technique. Where others relied solely on speed and luck, Sylro understood the tempo of the winds, the counter-currents, and the way to 'ride the chaos' rather than fight it. He won year after year, earning monikers such as *Tempest Treader* and *Windrider of the Maelstrom*.

With each victory, he grew more famous. He became a legendary pirate, feared and respected.
