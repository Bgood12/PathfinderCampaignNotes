Veriduna: Combines "Verde" (green) and "Lusitana", the Roman province that covers most of modern Portugal and parts of Spain.
AKA Fascist Fantasy Iberia

### Goals 
- The dream is to reassemble the old imperium from prior to the [[Veridunan Civil War]].
	- Assert control over the independent border kingdoms, and their old colony of [[Balaika]]
- Is a colonial power with growing colonies in the new world.

### History
History is slippery in Veriduna especially the events prior to the [[Veridunan Civil War]]. Veriduna's current rulers understand the inspiration that history can be and seek to eradicate the nation's non-infernal past. New state-sanctioned histories are periodically released to universities and administrative buildings with the old histories recollected.
After [[Queen Deodora Kasa]]'s reign ended after 25 years Veriduna has experienced succession turmoil with 4 different rulers in the following 15 years; before seeming to settle on [[Queen Deodora Kasa II]] the granddaughter of [[Queen Deodora Kasa]].

### Government
Head of State: [[Queen Deodora Kasa II]]
A configuration of noble houses that were willing to participate in devil worship make up the government of Veriduna. It's rumored that the noble houses continue making deals with devils for extra power. Those that do not follow the state religion keep it to themselves for fear of their bloodline being eradicated.
Infernal witnesses (bound imps) surveil government buildings, market squares, and temples while invisible.

### State Religion
Devil worship is the state religion of Veriduna. This came as a result of the deal made by [[Queen Deodora Kasa]] to end the [[Veridunan Civil War]]. Veriduna has codified devil worship. Citizens attend weekly Rites of Binding.

### Culture
There is absolute order in Veridunan society with no room allowed for dissent. Obedience is a near sacred civic virtue. A sense of nationalism is all but enforced as neighbors are incentivized to turn each other in for promises of wealth and prestige. 
The state promotes the idea of 'cultural purity' glorifying those with [[Veriduna|Veridunan]] bloodlines, while vilifying outside cultures and languages. Art forms are strictly censored.Only state sanctioned artists are allowed to perform publically.

### Military
Veriduna's military stands as a formidable force, boasting a combination of humanoid troops and infernal legions. Their engagement with devilish forces amplifies their might and ferocity.

#### Naming Conventions
Fascist Fantasy Iberia names tend to be very 'latin-esque' or Roman with some modern Italian names in the mix for variety.
