Admiral Drusilla Kasa of the [[Veriduna|Veridunan]] navy is an ambitious and effective naval tactician. She's also the cousin of [[Queen Deodora Kasa II]].

### Background
Drusilla was the second daughter of a cadet branch of [[House Kasa]]. As such she has considerable wealth and connections. She abandoned dreams of leisure at an early age as her older sister was the one married off to secure political advantages for the family. Drusilla's envy and curiosity as to why her sister's beauty was favored led her to an interest in the workings of the mind and she became an expert blackmailer.

She would later be sent to a military academy where she learned that her gifts in information gathering were best used to protect her nation from covert threats. After graduating Drusilla pursued a career in the navy due to her love of maps and the sea, as well as for the opportunity to scout threats both foreign and domestic. She rose quickly in the navy's ranks due both to her familial connections and her numerous military successes, including the destruction of two slave liberation networks.

She continuously seeks ways to increase her own prestige within the [[Veriduna|Veridunan]] government.
