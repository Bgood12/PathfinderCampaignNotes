AKA Fantasy Catalonia
Subdivision of [[Veriduna]]

### Geography
The Principality of Auravell has a relatively diverse ecosystem for a region of its size. It borders a mountain range in the [[Blackstone Peaks]], has a long coastline, has a large woodland region, as well as [[The Windswept Plains]] that it shares with [[Ezkardia]]. Auravell is largely cut off from the rest of [[Veriduna]] through the [[Blackstone Peaks]]. 

### History
When the First [[Veriduna|Veridunan]] empire was formed without officially including the Principality of Auravell due to a clerical error. The error was never corrected. When the [[Veridunan Civil War]] broke out Auravell insisted on independence. This insistence would eventually draw dissenents displeased with [[House Kasa|House Kasa's]] rule to the region.
By the conclusion of the [[Veridunan Civil War]] and birth of the Second Veridunan Empire Auravell was successfully subjugated by [[House Kasa]]. The peoples of Auravell now feign loyalty to conceal their nationalistic zeal.

### Economy
Auravell primary trades domestically with the rest of [[Veriduna]] via the Blackstone pass in the Blackstone Peaks mountain range through its mountainous border. Otherwise, most trade travels by sea. The regions primary exports are natural resources such as fish, lumber, and salt.

### Population
Auravell is primarily comprised of humans though halflings and tieflings both make up respectable minorities. Some dwarvish and orcish clans dwell among the [[Blackstone Peaks]]. Meanwhile, Auravell's woodlands house small groups of many disparate peoples. 
Several anti-slavery groups have operations in Auravell working to move slaves out of [[Veriduna]].
