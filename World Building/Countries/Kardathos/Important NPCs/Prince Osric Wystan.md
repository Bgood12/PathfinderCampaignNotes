**Appearance**
Osric was once tall and striking, and remnants of that nobility remain. However, undeath has hollowed him: his skin is pale and sallow, clinging tightly to his bones in some places, puffed with necrotic swelling in others. His eyes burn blue. His clothes are elegant but faded, old silks and heavy cloaks meant to mask the gauntness beneath.

**Personality/Demeanor**
Osric's voice is cultured but broken - alternating between rasping whispers and sudden flashes of commanding clarity. His movements are unsteady. 
In moments of clarity he is intelligent, reflective, and sharp-tongued, a brilliant strategist. In moments of weakness he mutters half coherent phrases, eyes flickering to things no one sees, as if haunted by visions.
