Guild Master: [[Archmagus Seraphine Deymaris]]

Members: [[Jade]]

#### History
The Circle of the Sapphire Flame is one of the oldest magical institutions in [[Kardathos]]. Its origins stretch nearly four centuries - created by a group of arcanists to preserve magical knowledge from newly conquered nations. 

#### Appearance
The guild hall itself is an austere, towering structure known as the Azure Hall, a fortress-like edifice of pale stone that stands out from the dense town surrounding it. Within is a labyrinth of libraries, reliquaries, ritual chambers, lecture halls, offices and the like. The walls are lined with aged portraits of former guild masters, their eyes following visitors with unnerving precision. Beneath the main structure are the vaults, containing sealed tomes and forgotten artifacts.

#### Reputation
The circle holds immense sway in [[Kardathos]]. Its members serve as court wizards, and advisors to noble families. Admission is highly competitive, especially for those not ofnoble lineage.

#### Current State
[[Archmagus Seraphine Deymaris]] became guild master a few short years ago. Outwardly she promotes stability, discipline and, civic service. She has quietly tightened the circle's control of records and knowledge. Members who probe too deeply into necromacy/soulcraft are likely to be resigned.
