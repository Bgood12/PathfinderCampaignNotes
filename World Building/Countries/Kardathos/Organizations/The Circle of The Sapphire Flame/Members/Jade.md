Bully of [[Eden Lockton]].

Jade entered the [[The Circle of The Sapphire Flame]] relatively young, leveraging both her magical talent and ruthless ambition. She has carved herself a niche researching planar anomalies as a junior member. She's ambitious enough to exploit secrets if it means advancement.

Sharp tongued and competitive with juniors.
Outwardly respectful, near sycophantic, towards seniors.
