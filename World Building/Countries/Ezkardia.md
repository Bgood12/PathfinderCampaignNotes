Ezkardia: "Ezkar" (Basque for "refuse") and "-dia" (common Basque suffix meaning "land")
AKA Fantasy Basque

### Geography
Ezkardia finds itself nestled between two mountain ranges, a coast, and a long stretch of rolling plains and grassy hills. The border of Ezkardia and [[Veriduna]] via the [[Principality of Auravell]] is located in the middle of [[The Windswept Plains]], while the [[Blackstone Peaks]] separate the nation from the [[Veriduna|Veridunan]] heartland. Numerous rivers criss-cross the land most leading to Ezkardia's jagged rugged coastline.

### Government
Ezkardia is a semi-democratic nation led by the Ezkardiko Batzar, which is comprised of representatives from every major region and town. The Batzar elects a Lehendakari as head of state.

### Culture
Ezkardia speaks a unique language that is lexically dissimilar from every other known language in the world. Ezkardians lake great pride in traditional sports such as log chopping and stone lifting. They're known for vibrant festivals where athletic competitions are central. The nation's enduring stability has allowed families to hone crafts for generations making Ezkardian artisan works, such as glass blowing, jewelry making, metal and wood working,  practically unparalleled.

### Economy
The relatively insular nature of Ezkardia means that the nation sees little in the way of trade. Most of the trade that it does see is via heavily policed coastal ports. Ezkardia's artisanal goods such as wine, textiles, and artisan crafts are in demand throughout the known world.

### Military
Ezkardia's military has a heavily defensive focus. Ezkardian pikemen halberdiers and other polearm wielders are renowned for their ability to hold the line in rough terrain. In the rare occurrences where they are needed on flat land they are are able to shred cavalry.
Ezkardia also hosts a small navy which is skilled in coastal defense.

### Spirituality
The spirituality of Ezkardia's people is deeply connected to nature and their homelands are viewed as sacred to them. This connection to their homelands has resulted in a people with little desire for expansion or imperialism. Folklore plays a significant role in Ezkardian beliefs with tales being passed through the generations. The morals of these tales often fortify values of independence and resilience. Despite their spirituality they do tend offer some homage to Gozreh.

### History
Ezkardia is perhaps the oldest human civilization in the world; able to track their history further than any other civilization can claim.  Throughout their long history their borders have remained unchanged albeit with a single partial exception. 
During the expansion of the First [[Veriduna|Veridunan]] empire Ezkardia was brought to the negotiating table for the first time after near three decades of fighting. Ezkardia bristled firmly under the boot of [[Veriduna|Veridunan]] dominance for the next 250 years prior to the [[Veridunan Civil War]].
During the war Ezkardia made a deal with [[Queen Deodora Kasa]] of [[House Kasa]] to support her claim to the throne in exchange for their guaranteed independence and the removal of all Veridunan agents from Ezkardia. The nation has been independent ever since.
