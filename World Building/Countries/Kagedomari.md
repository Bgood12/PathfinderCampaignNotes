### Government
Kagedomari is ruled by an Emperor, though true power rests with the Shōgun who commands military and administrative authority. The nation is divided into provinces, each named after its capital city and governed by an imperial governor appointed by the Shōgun. These governors oversee taxation, law enforcement, and military recruitment within their domains.

Some mountainous and remote regions lack governors and operate with greater independence. These areas are often home to minor lords, monastic orders, or self-governing communities that pay nominal tribute to the central authority but are otherwise left to their own devices.

The current Shōgun is consolidating power after decades of internal conflict between provincial lords. This unification is incomplete—some provinces remain nominally loyal while harboring ambitions of independence, and the ungoverned regions serve as havens for those displaced by the consolidation.

### Geography
Kagedomari is a relatively isolated nation comprising a peninsula and several minor outlying islands. The peninsula connects to the mainland via the [[Yōkai Isthmus]], a narrow and hazardous passage that harbors a planar rift to the Feywild. The rift causes reality to blur in the isthmus's depths—travelers report time dilation, impossible geometry, and encounters with fey creatures. Human populations in the Yōkai Isthmus are extremely sparse, and the border regions nearest the rift are completely uninhabited.

The nation's terrain is predominantly mountainous with narrow coastal plains and river valleys where most settlements are located. Dense forests cover much of the interior. The isolation provided by the Yōkai Isthmus has allowed Kagedomari to develop a distinct culture with minimal external influence.

### History
Kagedomari recently emerged from a period of fragmentation where provincial governors and warlords fought for supremacy. The current Shōgun rose to power through a combination of military conquest, strategic alliances, and ruthless suppression of rivals. The consolidation process continues, with resistance strongest in regions furthest from the capital and nearest the Yōkai Isthmus, where central authority is difficult to project.

The nation's isolation via the Yōkai Isthmus has historically protected it from large-scale invasions, though occasional fey incursions from the rift require military response.

### Economy
Kagedomari's economy is based on rice cultivation in the coastal plains and river valleys, fishing, and mineral extraction from the mountainous interior. The nation produces high-quality steel, ceramics, silk, and lacquerware. Trade with the mainland is limited due to the dangers of the Yōkai Isthmus, making Kagedomari largely self-sufficient.

Merchants willing to brave the Yōkai Isthmus can command premium prices for Kagedomari goods in mainland markets, and vice versa. Some coastal settlements have developed as trading ports where mainland and Kagedomari merchants exchange goods without crossing the isthmus entirely—using island waypoints and careful timing to minimize exposure to the rift's effects.

The ongoing consolidation has disrupted internal trade routes and forced some provinces to become more self-reliant. The Shōgun is working to rebuild infrastructure and reestablish safe roads between provinces.

### Culture
- Honorable cultural identity
Kagedomari culture emphasizes honor, duty, and loyalty to one's lord. A rigid social hierarchy exists with the warrior class (samurai) at the top, followed by farmers, artisans, and merchants. Personal reputation and family honor are paramount. Insults or failures of duty are often answered with ritual suicide to restore honor.

The nation has a strong tradition of martial training. Swordsmanship, archery, and unarmed combat are refined arts practiced by the warrior class. Dojos and martial schools compete for students and prestige.

Ancestor veneration is central to spiritual life. Families maintain shrines to deceased relatives, and it is believed that honorable ancestors watch over and protect their descendants. Shamans and monks serve as intermediaries between the living and the dead, and between the mortal world and the spirit realm.

Tea ceremonies, calligraphy, poetry, and theater are valued cultural practices. Even warriors are expected to cultivate refinement alongside martial prowess. The concept of "the way of the warrior" emphasizes mastery of both sword and brush.

The proximity of the Feywild rift has influenced Kagedomari's folklore and spiritual beliefs. Fey creatures, yokai, and spirits feature prominently in stories, and certain locations—particularly near the Yōkai Isthmus—are considered spiritually significant or dangerous. Shrines and wards are maintained along the isthmus to contain the rift's influence.

### Military
Kagedomari's military is built around the samurai class—professional warriors who serve provincial governors and the Shōgun. Samurai are trained from youth in swordsmanship, horsemanship, and archery. They follow a strict code of conduct emphasizing loyalty, courage, and honor.

Ashigaru—commoner foot soldiers—supplement samurai forces with spear formations and ranged support. The current Shōgun has begun modernizing warfare by incorporating gunpowder weapons acquired through limited trade with the mainland, though traditional warriors view these with suspicion.

Castles and fortified positions dot the landscape, remnants of the recent conflicts. Some remain garrisoned by loyalists, others by holdouts resisting the Shōgun's authority.

Specialized units exist to deal with fey incursions from the Yōkai Isthmus. These warriors are trained in countering otherworldly threats and carry iron weapons and protective talismans.

### Inhabitants
Kagedomari's population is predominantly human, concentrated in the coastal plains and river valleys. Social stratification is rigid, with limited mobility between classes.

A sizable tengu minority inhabits the mountainous regions. Tengu communities often serve as messengers, scouts, and spies due to their natural abilities. Some tengu have integrated into the broader society as artisans, swordmasters, and monks, while others maintain isolated mountain monasteries and settlements. The relationship between tengu and the human majority varies by region—some provinces treat them as valued subjects and honored warriors, others with suspicion due to their ties to the spirit world.

Small populations of hengeyokai (shapeshifting animal-folk) live in remote areas, particularly near the Yōkai Isthmus where the boundary between worlds is thin.

### Major Settlements
- **Oda**: The imperial capital, seat of the Emperor and the Shōgun. A sprawling city of wooden buildings, defensive walls, and the massive imperial palace complex. Center of political power and culture.
- **Tesshin**: A major port city on the eastern coast. Known for its cosmopolitan atmosphere and merchant guilds. Serves as a waypoint for coastal trade around the peninsula.
- **Yamakage**: A fortress-city in the mountains, home to influential tengu clans and several renowned martial schools. Semi-autonomous and resistant to full centralization.
