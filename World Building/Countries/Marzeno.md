Inspiration: Militarized northern Italy during the Renaissance
Marzeno: From Mars the Roman god of war.

_Country Name_ desperately wants to be an empire that rivals the other powers of the region. Though its ambitions outstrip its abilities.

#### Geography
Marzeno occupies a small boot-shaped peninsula jutting from a wide isthmus between the continents of [[Fantasy Europe]] and [[Alkebulan]]. This strategic position gives the nation control over key maritime routes between the two continents, though the peninsula's limited size constrains territorial expansion.

#### Government
Marzeno is ruled by an Imperial Governor selected by the Council of Generals—the commanding officers of the imperial army. Each general is an effective statesman capable of managing territorial ambitions and conducting hostilities against rivals. This system ensures military priorities dominate governance, as generals are more capable of advancing expansionist goals than civilian administrators would be.

The Imperial Governor serves at the pleasure of the generals and can be replaced if they fail to pursue Marzeno's territorial ambitions aggressively enough. This creates a government constantly seeking opportunities for expansion, as any governor who appears weak risks removal.

#### History
Marzeno's current system emerged from a period of internal chaos when competing merchant families and local lords fragmented the peninsula. A coalition of military commanders seized control, arguing that only unified military rule could transform the fractured peninsula into a true power. They established the Council of Generals and began aggressive expansion, though their ambitions consistently outstrip their capabilities.

#### Economy
Marzeno has established dominance in shipping and transportation throughout the immediate region through a combination of robust workforce, strategic location, and advantageous trade agreements often secured through military pressure. The nation is rich in natural resources including iron, marble, timber, and fertile farmland, though much of this wealth is funneled into military expenditure.

The rigid class system ensures cheap labor for resource extraction and agriculture, while the promise of citizenship through military service provides a constant supply of soldiers. Trade flows through Marzeno's ports as merchants from both continents meet to exchange goods, enriching the nation through tariffs and port fees.

#### Culture
Marzenian culture glorifies military service and imperial expansion. Citizens are expected to support the nation's territorial ambitions, and public celebrations often commemorate military victories. The eagle -symbol of imperial Rome- features prominently in Marzenian iconography, appearing on banners, architecture, and official seals.

Art and architecture imitate classical imperial styles, with marble columns, triumphal arches, and grand forums dotting the cities. The aristocracy patronizes artists and scholars who produce works celebrating Marzenian military prowess and destiny for greatness.

Despite the martial culture, Marzeno has a thriving merchant class among the imperial citizens. Banking houses, trading companies, and craft guilds wield considerable economic influence, though they remain subordinate to military authority.

#### Population
Marzeno's population is divided by a rigid class system:

**Imperial Citizens** live in larger towns and cities and enjoy relative privilege. They can trade with foreigners, migrate freely within the nation, and participate in local government. Citizenship is hereditary for those born to citizen parents, or earned through five years of military service.

**Laborers** are indentured servants who work the farms and forests of rural areas. They have limited legal rights and restricted movement. The primary path to citizenship for laborers is military service, though this is unpopular with the aristocracy who prefer to maintain a large laboring class.

**Slaves** form the lowest class. Ownership is strictly regulated, and slaves can earn their freedom and gain legal status through a lengthy bureaucratic process. Many slaves opt for military service as a faster route to citizenship.

The promise of citizenship through military service attracts significant immigrant and refugee populations, as foreigners who complete five years of service gain the same rights as native-born citizens. This policy has swelled the army's ranks while creating a diverse military force.

#### Military
Marzeno's military is the nation's defining institution. The army is large relative to the nation's size, fueled by the citizenship-for-service policy. Units are organized into legions commanded by the generals who sit on the ruling council.

The military explicitly allows enlistment of monstrous soldiers—orcs, hobgoblins, minotaurs, and other typically hostile species can earn citizenship through service. This creates diverse military units and has made Marzeno's army unpredictable to opponents unfamiliar with fighting alongside monstrous allies.

Infantry forms the core of Marzenian forces, supported by crossbowmen and pike formations. The navy is well-developed due to the nation's peninsular geography and focus on controlling maritime trade routes. Naval galleys crewed by a mix of citizens, laborers seeking citizenship, and slaves row alongside sailing vessels.

Officers are typically drawn from the aristocracy or promoted from the ranks after distinguished service. Meritocracy within the military is encouraged, as the generals recognize that competent commanders are essential for their expansionist goals.

#### Foreign Relations
Marzeno's belligerence and opportunistic expansionism mean it has no true allies. Neighboring nations view Marzeno with suspicion or open hostility, as the imperial government seizes any opportunity to advance territorial claims. This isolation limits Marzeno's ability to achieve its imperial ambitions, as it must constantly guard against multiple potential enemies.

Trade relationships are maintained out of mutual economic interest rather than genuine friendship, and even these are strained by Marzeno's habit of using military pressure to secure favorable terms.

#### Major Settlements
- **Aquilar**: (Aquila - Roman Eagle) The capital city, seat of the Imperial Governor and the Council of Generals. Home to grand forums, marble government buildings adorned with eagle imagery, and the massive Arch of Triumph commemorating past victories. The city's harbor is heavily fortified and serves as the primary naval base.
- **Portus Ferro**: A major port city on the western coast, center of the iron trade and shipbuilding industry. The forges run constantly, producing weapons and armor for the expanding military.
- **Montecittà**: A fortified city in the peninsula's interior, built on defensible high ground. Home to training grounds where new recruits—citizens, laborers, immigrants, and monstrous soldiers—are drilled into legionary discipline.
