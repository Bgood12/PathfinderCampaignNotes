Bloodwake Harbor is a bustling pirate port and stronghold nestled in a crescent-shaped bay. Ruled by the iron-willed [['Admiral' Nylora Monteiro]], Bloodwake Harbor has risen to prominence as a hub of piracy, commerce, and culture, combining the rowdy chaos of a pirate haven with surprising touches of refinement.

#### Defenses
The harbor's geography is its first line of defense. The narrow entrance is flanked by tall, weather-beaten watchtowers constructed of stone and reinforced wood. These towers bristle with cannons and ballistae, manned day and night by sharp-eyed lookouts and seasoned gunners. Ships must navigate the winding approach carefully, lest they run aground on jagged rocks or find themselves bombarded by the towers' defenses.

A chain boom stretches across the harbor's entrance and can be raised to block enemy ships. On the cliffs above, hidden artillery positions provide an additional layer of protection. [['Admiral' Nylora Monteiro|Monteiro’s]] fleet patrols the surrounding waters, ensuring no unwelcome guests draw too close.

#### Government and Law
Bloodwake Harbor is governed by [['Admiral' Nylora Monteiro]], who rules with a mix of cunning diplomacy and ruthless enforcement. While the harbor thrives on piracy and lawlessness, Monteiro maintains a strict code of conduct for its inhabitants:
- **No Veridunans**: Monteiro’s hatred of her homeland drives this policy. Any [[Veriduna|Veridunan]] caught within the harbor is jailed or expelled, and suspicion of [[Veriduna|Veridunan]] spies is enough to incite violence.
- **Respect the Harbor**: Fights are forbidden in certain areas, particularly the docks and the market square. Violators are dragged before [['Admiral' Nylora Monteiro|Monteiro]] or her enforcers for swift judgment.
- **Tithe to the Admiral**: All pirates operating out of the harbor must pay a cut of their earnings to [['Admiral' Nylora Monteiro|Monteiro]] in exchange for the harbor’s protection.
