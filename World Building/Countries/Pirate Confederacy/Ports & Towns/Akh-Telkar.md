Akh-Telkar is an independent, lawless haven on the high seas, known as a "Free Port" frequented by pirates, smugglers, and those who prefer to operate outside the influence of any nation. While it serves as a chaotic trading hub, what truly sets Akh-Telkar apart is its deadly reputation as the home of the feared [[Crimson Scorpions]], a mercenary company known for their secrecy, ruthless efficiency, and enigmatic masked warriors.


- "Free Port"
	- frequented by pirates
	- Not considered part of the [[Pirate Confederacy]]
- Home to the [[Crimson Scorpions]] mercenaries
	- Reputation of the mercenaries has so far deterred foreign navies
- Most trade is directed around the west side of the island due to the presence of [[The Maelstrom]]
- Crimson Scorpions wear full facemasks when on jobs and encourage non-members to use their signature Kalis swords to maintain an air of mystery


#### Government
Akh-Telkar operates under a laissez-faire system where contracts and reputation mean more than written law. Though the island is self-governed, the [[Crimson Scorpions]] serve as its unofficial rulers, not through direct governance but through the unspoken understanding that crossing them means death. The Scorpions keep the peace in a roundabout way; their mere presence discourages outside threats, including foreign navies and large-scale conflicts.

Due to their reputation, most pirates and independent merchants know better than to start trouble. Disputes are handled privately—sometimes with a dagger in the back, other times with a paid-off Scorpion arbitrating in exchange for a hefty fee.

#### Geography
Akh-Telkar is isolated and difficult to reach, flanked by treacherous waters and flanked to the east by [[The Maelstrom]], a churning whirlpool that has devoured many careless ships. 

The island itself is full of dense jungle and steep cliffs, making it both a natural fortress and a death trap. It is home to prehistoric creatures, including dinosaurs, which roam freely in the island's interior.

Several lesser islands dot the area around Akh-Telkar, many of which serve as hiding spots for caches, training grounds for the [[Crimson Scorpions]], or bases for those who want proximity to the island without being directly involved in its politics.

The interior jungle is largely unexplored. Expeditions into the jungle are rare and often result in mysterious disappearances.

#### Economy
Akh-Telkar functions as something of a trade hub due to its complete lack of restrictions.
**Primary Goods & Services:**
- Mercenary Services – The Crimson Scorpions take on high-paying contracts, but other independent fighters also offer their services here.

While pirates, smugglers, and bounty hunters make up the bulk of the island’s inhabitants, many wealthy merchants send representatives to do business in secret, acquiring rare and illicit goods without fear of punitive measures.
