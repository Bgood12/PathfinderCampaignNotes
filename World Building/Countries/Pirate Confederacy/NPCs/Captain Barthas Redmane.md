#### Appearance
Barthas Redmane cuts an imposing figure, his wild beard of crimson hair framing a face etched with the scars of a lifetime at sea. His sharp jawline and weathered leathery skin tell the story of countless battles and betrayals, while his piercing amber eye—the only one left to him—glints with the cunning of a man who has survived far longer than he should have His left eye is milky and useless, covered with a red cloth, but his gaze remains as intense as ever.

He wears an open leather doublet, worn by years of salty air and water. The crimson sash at his waist provides a splash of color against his otherwise muted garb. His black boots, high and well-crafted, are built for both deck and battlefield. At his hips hangs his a pair of battleaxes, beautiful but well-worn blades with an elaborate guard.

#### Personality
Barthas Redmane is a pirate lord, but never the most feared one - and that fact gnaws at him. He was never the grandest, never the richest, never the most dreaded—but he is one of the most determined. He carries himself with an air of self-assured arrogance, the kind of man who laughs at his own misfortunes as if the world were a grand, cruel joke meant to be played on others.

He is charming in a rough, unpolished way, capable of drinking and joking with his crew one moment and running a man through the next without a change in demeanor. Pragmatic but proud, he has little patience for weakness but respects resilience, regardless of where it comes from.
