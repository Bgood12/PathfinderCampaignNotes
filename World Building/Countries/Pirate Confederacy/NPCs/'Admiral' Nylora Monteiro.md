### Appearance
Admiral Nylora Monteiro is a strikingly imposing elven woman, her commanding presence amplified by her sharp features and an air of unapologetic confidence. Her form is full and robust, unusual for an elf, but she carries herself with the regal poise of someone accustomed to respect—and getting what she wants. Her squinty, almond-shaped eyes are perpetually half-lidded, giving her an expression that’s equal parts shrewd and disarming. Her dark auburn hair is always immaculately styled beneath a wide-brimmed [[Veriduna|Veridunan]] naval hat, adorned with a feather and a glinting golden pin. She favors tailored coats of deep crimson and gold, symbols of her once-lofty status, now a touch threadbare from her years on the high seas.

### Personality
Admiral Monteiro exudes a mix of charm and steely resolve. Her honeyed drawl drips with a blend of mockery and affection, calling others “darlin’,” “handsome,” or “sweetie” regardless of whether she’s threatening or praising them. She has a talent for balancing warmth with intimidation, a skill that keeps both her allies and enemies guessing.

Caring and fiercely protective of those she deems her allies, Monteiro is quick to lend her aid or wisdom—but woe to anyone who crosses her. Her vengeance is swift, calculating, and merciless. She’s an astute strategist. Her penchant for [[Veriduna|Veridunan]] opera hints at a cultured side that contrasts with her ruthless reputation, and she retains an appreciation for the finer things in life, even in the rough and tumble of pirate society.

### Background
Born into privilege, Nylora Monteiro was the daughter of a famed [[Veriduna|Veridunan]] commodore, raised in the halls of naval command and groomed for excellence. Her early career in the [[Veriduna|Veridunan]] navy saw her rise quickly to the rank of captain, her skill in naval strategy matched only by her ability to inspire loyalty in her crew. Sponsored by a member of [[House Kasa]], her swift ascent to admiral came with strings attached. However, her patron eventually betrayed her, attempting to scapegoat her for political intrigue gone awry.

Monteiro’s response was swift and audacious. Refusing to be a pawn, she rallied a half-dozen loyal ships whose sailors pledged fealty to her years prior and mutinied, escaping [[Veriduna]] with the navy hot on her heels. Using her cunning and knowledge of naval tactics, she outmaneuvered her pursuers and disappeared into the seas. But Monteiro was far from finished. Arriving at [[Bloodwake Harbor]], she found it dominated by unruly pirates. With her loyal fleet, she launched a bold assault, sinking a dozen pirate vessels and seizing control of the harbor.

Under her rule, [[Bloodwake Harbor]] became a hub of organized piracy, and her leadership earned her a seat on the Pirate Council. Despite the chaos of her new life, Monteiro maintains a love for [[Veriduna|Veridunan]] opera and clings to elements of her once-lavish lifestyle, indulging in fine wines, and music when her spoils allow.
