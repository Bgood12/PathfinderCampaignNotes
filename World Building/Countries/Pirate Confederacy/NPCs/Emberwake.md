**Appearance**
Valeria exudes an unsettling presence, even among hardened pirates. Her [[Veriduna|Veridunan]] lineage is unmistakable - high cheekbones, pale skin touched by the barest hint of olive, and amber eyes like burning embers that seem to flicker with inner fire when she’s deep in thought.

She wears elegantly tailored black leather, sleek enough for swift movement. Around her neck hangs a pendant of brass and hematite, shaped like an infernal sigil, though few recognize its meaning. Her gloves, lined with silver runes, hide faint burn scars—marks of her past dealings with fiends.

A dagger of cold iron rests at her hip, its edge engraved with a pacifying glyph, while a tome bound in crimson leather is chained to her belt. On rare occasions, when invoking her dark magic, her shadow moves unnaturally, shifting and stretching as though whispering secrets in an unseen language.
