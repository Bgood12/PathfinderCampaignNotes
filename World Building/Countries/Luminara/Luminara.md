#### Geography
Luminara occupies territory on the northern coast of Alkebulan, directly across a narrow strait from Kardathos. The nation controls both sides of this strait—the southern side as its mainland territory and the northern side seized during the [[Kardathan Civil War]]. This gives Luminara complete control over the strait and the only naval passage between the interior sea and the ocean.

The interior features rolling hills, fertile river valleys, and at least one sizable inland lake. The climate is temperate along the coast and more arid as one moves inland toward the desert regions of Alkebulan's interior.

#### Government
Luminara is a theocracy governed by [[The Radiant Synod]], the hierarchical leadership of the nation's dominant religious institution. The Synod is composed of high-ranking clergy who interpret divine will and administer both spiritual and temporal authority. The head of the Synod—the Exarch—serves as both religious and political leader.

The Radiant Synod acknowledges that multiple gods exist but claims exclusive authority to interpret divine will and administer proper worship. They position themselves as necessary intermediaries between mortals and the divine, maintaining that worship conducted outside Church sanction is dangerous and heretical. The Church licenses temples, authorizes clergy, standardizes religious practices, and controls access to holy sites.

Provincial governors are appointed by the Synod and are typically high-ranking clergy. Local administration is handled by Church officials, with secular functionaries serving in subordinate roles. Civil law and religious law are functionally identical.

#### History
Luminara's theocratic government traces its authority to a founding prophet who claimed to receive divine revelation on proper worship and the coming daemon threat. The Church grew from a religious movement into a political power, eventually establishing control over the region.

During the [[Kardathan Civil War]], Luminara seized the opportunity to occupy the northern side of the strait, claiming it was necessary to protect the region from the chaos spilling out of Kardathos. They fortified their position and have held it since, transforming a temporary occupation into permanent control. [[Kardathos]] views this as an illegal seizure and wants the territory returned, but lacks the strength to reclaim it while dealing with internal instability.

#### The Daemon Threat
Luminara's justification for Church authority rests on the daemon threat. Daemons—neutral evil outsiders from the plane of Abaddon—do periodically breach into the material plane in Luminara, particularly near the inland lake which sits atop ancient battlegrounds and mass graves.

The Church claims specialized knowledge and divine blessing to contain these incursions. Church Wardens and Exorcists respond to daemon sightings, perform binding rituals, and maintain wards at known breach points.

However, the Church deliberately allows minor daemon incursions to occur. They maintain the threat at a level high enough to justify their authority and necessity, but controlled enough not to genuinely endanger their power. The Church may even facilitate small breaches, then heroically contain them to demonstrate their indispensability. This manipulation is known only to the highest levels of the [[The Radiant Synod|Synod]].

#### Economy 
Luminara's economy benefits enormously from controlling the strait. All maritime trade between the interior sea (where the [[Sultanate of Qalithar]] and other nations trade) and the ocean must pass through Luminaran waters. The Church levies substantial tariffs on this traffic, generating immense wealth.

The nation also produces grain, olives, wine, and citrus from its fertile valleys. The inland lake supports fishing and freshwater trade. Pilgrims traveling to Church-sanctioned holy sites provide additional revenue.

The Church controls significant landholdings worked by tenant farmers. Tithes are mandatory, with the Church claiming a portion of all economic activity as divine due.

#### Culture
Luminaran culture revolves entirely around [[The Radiant Synod]]. Religious observance is public, mandatory, and closely monitored. Art, music, and literature are expected to glorify the gods as interpreted by the Church. Unauthorized religious expression is suppressed.

Education is controlled by the Church. Literacy is taught primarily to train clergy, though merchant and noble families ensure their children receive Church-approved schooling. The Church maintains libraries and scriptoriums where approved texts are copied and distributed.

Public festivals celebrate Church holy days with processions, ceremonies, and demonstrations of piety. These events serve both religious and political functions, reinforcing Church authority and allowing citizens to demonstrate loyalty.

Luminaran citizens are taught to view their nation as a beacon of divine order in a chaotic world. Other nations are seen as lacking proper spiritual guidance, with their religious practices viewed as ignorant at best, heretical at worst.

#### Military
**The Luminaran Army** consists of conventional soldiers who defend borders, garrison the occupied strait territory, and project military power. The officer corps includes both clergy and secular nobles, though clergy hold higher authority.

**Church Wardens** are militant clergy trained in combat and daemon containment. They serve as religious enforcers, hunting heretics, investigating supernatural incidents, and responding to daemon incursions. Wardens have authority to override secular military commanders when dealing with "spiritual threats."

**Exorcists** are elite Wardens specializing in combating extraplanar entities. They undergo extensive training in binding rituals, protective wards, and divine magic focused on banishment and containment.

The **Luminaran Navy** controls the strait and patrols the interior sea. Naval supremacy is essential to maintaining their economic stranglehold and projecting power.

#### Foreign Relations
Luminara's control of the strait creates tension with nearly every nation that trades through the interior sea. [[Sultanate of Qalithar|Qalithar]] particularly resents being forced to pay Luminaran tariffs for access to oceanic trade, but the Sultan lacks the naval power to challenge them.

[[Kardathos]] views Luminara's occupation of the northern strait as theft. The two nations maintain cold relations, with Kardathan spies seek ways to undermine Luminaran control. [[Queen Meira Wystan]] likely calculates whether she can afford a war to reclaim the territory while managing internal enemies.

The Church seeks to expand its spiritual authority beyond Luminara's borders, sending missionaries to other nations and claiming jurisdiction over religious matters wherever they can establish presence. Most nations resist this, viewing [[The Radiant Synod]] as an invasive foreign power.

Luminara views heretical practices in neighboring nations as dangerous and potentially subject to Church intervention. This attitude creates constant friction and has led to limited military conflicts justified as "protecting the faithful" or "containing daemon threats."

#### Population
Luminara's population is predominantly human, with smaller populations of halflings, dwarves, and other common races. The Church officially welcomes all races willing to submit to [[The Radiant Synod|Synod]] authority, though humans dominate the clergy hierarchy.

Religious compliance is mandatory. Citizens who express doubts about Church doctrine or practice unauthorized worship face investigation by Wardens. Penalties range from public penance to imprisonment, with severe cases resulting in execution for heresy.

A small population of tieflings exists, viewed with suspicion due to their fiendish heritage. The Church watches them closely, though tieflings who demonstrate exceptional piety can earn grudging acceptance.

#### Major Settlements
- **Radiance**: The capital city on the southern coast of the strait. Home to the Grand Cathedral where the Exarch resides and the Radiant Synod convenes. The city is filled with churches, monasteries, and Church administrative buildings. The harbor is heavily fortified and serves as the primary naval base.
- **Sanctus Gate**: The fortified city on the northern side of the strait (the occupied Kardathan territory). This fortress-city controls all naval traffic through the strait. Heavily garrisoned with both military and Wardens. The city's population is mixed Luminaran settlers and resentful former Kardathan subjects.
- **Lacrimosa**: A major city on the shores of the inland lake. Known as the center of Exorcist training and daemon containment. The lake's shores are dotted with Churches and binding circles. Pilgrims visit to witness Exorcist demonstrations and receive blessings of protection.
