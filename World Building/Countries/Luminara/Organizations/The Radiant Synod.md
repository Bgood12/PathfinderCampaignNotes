The Radiant Synod is the Church organization that governs [[Luminara]] and claims spiritual authority far beyond the nation's borders. The Church's doctrine emphasizes order, obedience to divine hierarchy, and the necessity of Church mediation between mortals and gods.

#### Structure
- **The Exarch**: Supreme leader, both spiritual and temporal authority
- **Arch-Prelates**: Govern provinces and oversee major Church functions
- **Prelates**: Administer cities, towns, and large temples
- **Priests**: Conduct services, perform rituals, manage local parishes
- **Wardens**: Church enforcers, handle inquisition and daemon containment
- **Exorcists**: Specialized Wardens trained in combating extraplanar threats

#### Doctrine
The Church teaches that gods exist but proper worship requires Church authority. Unsanctioned religious practices are deemed heretical and dangerous—claiming such practices attract daemons and corrupt divine magic. The Church positions itself as protector of humanity against supernatural threats, particularly daemon incursions.

Citizens are expected to attend weekly services, observe Church holy days, and report heretical activities. The Church maintains extensive records of citizens' religious compliance.
