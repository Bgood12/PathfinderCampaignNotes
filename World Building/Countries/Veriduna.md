Veriduna: Combines "Verde" (green) and "Lusitana", the Roman province that covers most of modern Portugal and parts of Spain.
AKA Fascist Fantasy Iberia


### History
History is slippery in Veriduna especially the events prior to the [[Veridunan Civil War]]. Veriduna's current rulers understand the inspiration that history can be and seek to eradicate the nations non-infernal past. New state-sanctioned histories are periodically released to universities and administrative buildings with the old histories recollected.

### State Religion
Devil worship is the state religion of Veriduna. This came as a result of the deal made by [[Queen Deodora Kasa]] to end the [[Veridunan Civil War]].

#### Naming Conventions
Fascist Fantasy Iberia names tend to be very 'latin-esque' or Roman with some modern Italian names in the mix for variety.
