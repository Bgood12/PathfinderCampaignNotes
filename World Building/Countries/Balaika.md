### History
Balaika was a colony of [[Veriduna]] that declared independence during the [[Veridunan Civil War]]. Following the [[Veridunan Civil War]] [[House Kasa]] sought to reclaim the lost colony in a step twards reviving Imperial Veriduna. Balaika knowing that it couldn't stand against the might of the Veridunan navy made its own 'deal with  the devil'.
To cement their independence Balaika made a deal with the [[Pirate Confederacy]] to pay tribute in exchange for protection from Veriduna. This agreement ended up giving rise to [[The First Pirate King]]; whom led the combined pirate armada against the Veridunan navy.

### Political Unrest
The high cost of the tribute, protection money according to some pirates, paid by Balaika to the [[Pirate Confederacy]] leaves the former colonial nation's coffers light. This makes it difficult for the colonial minority to keep control over the native inhabitants of the area.
