Kharakhai is a vast, rugged territory on the eastern edge of [[Serikara]]. It's home to nomadic centaur "horse lords" who roam its windswept steppes. Whilethey pay homage to the Padishah of [[Serikara]], their true loyalty lies with their clan chieftains and the ancient traditions of their people. 

Kharakhai is a land of endless skies, rolling plains, and fierce winds. For the [[Serikara|Serikaran]] Empire, Kharakhai represents both a distant frontier and a buffer zone, with its proud nomadic warriors acting as guardians of the empire’s western borders.

## Geography
Kharakhai’s defining feature is its vast, open steppes—endless plains that stretch out as far as the eye can see, broken only by occasional rivers, rocky outcroppings, and sparse woodlands. The land is both beautiful and harsh, with bitterly cold winters and scorching summers. It is a place where the wind never seems to stop.

The Khariin Winds, strong and relentless, shape both the landscape and the lives of Kharakhai’s inhabitants. These winds blow across the plains year-round, making life for sedentary peoples difficult, but ideal for the centaur nomads who have learned to thrive in the ever-moving world of the steppes.



## Government
Kharakhai’s political structure is highly decentralized, with power resting in the hands of individual clan chieftains rather than a unified government. Each **Khan** leads their clan with near-absolute authority, making decisions on behalf of their people and guiding them through the challenges of nomadic life. However, in times of external threat or when unity is required, the Khans will convene a council to choose a **Great Khan**, a leader who unites the tribes under a single banner for the duration of the crisis.

While Kharakhai is officially a sultanate of [[Serikara]], paying homage to the Padishah, this allegiance is largely symbolic. The centaurs have little interest in imperial bureaucracy or centralized rule, and the empire’s control over Kharakhai is limited to collecting tribute and maintaining diplomatic ties. The Padishah’s Emir, stationed in a small outpost on the western edge of Kharakhai, acts more as a mediator and liaison than a true ruler.

The Great Khan is chosen only when necessary, usually in times of war or conflict, and their leadership lasts only as long as the need for unity remains. Once the crisis is resolved, the clans return to their independent ways, often resuming their own internal rivalries.

## Culture
The culture of Kharakhai is built around two core concepts: freedom and the sky. The centaurs value their ability to roam the open plains freely, unbound by the walls and constraints of settled life. To them, the vast expanse of the steppes is sacred, and their connection to the land is both practical and spiritual.

Their reverence for the **sky** and **wind** reflects their dependence on the natural elements. The centaurs believe that their lives are guided by the winds. The Khariin Winds, which sweep across the steppes year-round provide guidance and direction in the vast, open wilderness.

Centaurs are known for their competitive nature, and contests of strength and speed are common. The annual Windrider Games are a major cultural event, where centaurs from across Kharakhai gather to compete in races, archery, and wrestling. These games are both a display of power and an opportunity to settle disputes between clans.
