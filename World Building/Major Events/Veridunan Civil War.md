In 1181 the Veridunan Civil War broke out. It initially started when [[House Kasa]] reignited an old territorial dispute against a rival family that they have since eradicated from history.

The war featured countless small tyrants rising to power promising shelter to the increasingly worsening conditions during the nearly 2 decade long conflict.

[[Queen Deodora Kasa]] eventually brought the Veridunan heartlands under control with theaid of devilish legions after pledging herself and her family to an arch devil.

19 years after [[House Kasa]] started the war [[Queen Deodora Kasa]] ended the war with the aid of devilish legions at the [[Battle of 100 Kings]].

Several border kingdoms and a colony declared independence during the conflict. Most have yet to be brought back under Veridunan rule.
