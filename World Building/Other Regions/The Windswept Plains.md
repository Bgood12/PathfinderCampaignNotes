The plains between the [[Principality of Auravell]] and [[Ezkardia]] stretch out in a seemingly endless expanse of golden grass, ever undulating under the brisk breeze that sweeps through the region. Here the horizon stretches forever on a hazy line.

### Geography
The Windswept Plains are mostly flat with shallow valleys and gentle rises to break apart the monotony. The grasses which dominate the area are hardy and resilient, ranging from rich gold to soft green.

### Climate
The plains experience a temperate climate. The winds that give this region its name are ever present, often fierce and biting especially in the Winter. The Spring brings common thunderstorms which roll through the plains in dramatic flashes.

### Settlements
Settlements are fairly uncommon on the Windswept Plains. Most are small tight-knit communities. These communities are usually self-sufficient with agriculture and livestock to sustain themselves. These livestock are most commonly bison and horses. The architecture is built simple, functional, and low to the ground to withstand the constant strong winds.
