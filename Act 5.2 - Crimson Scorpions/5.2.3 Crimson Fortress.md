Fortress built into a cliff face.

**Entrance Hall**
The stone corridor opens into a vaulted chamber lit by dull red lanterns. There are no banners, no insignia, no warmth. Just cold discipline that needs not speak its name.

**Training Area**
The floor here has been dyed a permanent brown from years of blood stains. Figures train in pairs exchanging quick light blows. There are no shouts, just the tangs of steel on steel interspersed with sharp hisses of breath.

- Mark 8 tiles


**Mess Hall**
Long narrow tables fill the chamber with perfect symmetry - no decoration. The food seems bland and overcooked.

(Kitchen)
A cook in dark leather moves with practiced robotic precision- chopping, boiling, plating. The walls are spotless, the knives are honed to surgical sharpness. A ledger on the counter tracks every item consumed.


**Meditation Chamber**
A few trainees sit cross legged in silence on worn cushions, ramrod straight. A masked figure watches over them.

**Armoury**
Lines of weapons line one wall, each meticulously placed point sticking up. There are sections on the opposing wall with knives and lengths of steel garrote. A case holds exotic weapons.

**Archive**
The walls here are carved with precise alcoves - each holding a single bound scroll sealed with wax and numbered in red ink. The air smells of old parchment, oil, and something metalic (blood).

- Two on lookout - one in reserve


**Lounge**
Low velvet couches, dark wood walls, and a decanter of amber liquor left half full. There's an unattended harp in the corner with a single string broken. Two figures play a silent game of knives on a table marked with cuts.

**Bath**
The bath chamber is carved from obsidian, its basin filled with steaming water tinted pink, towels rest arranged in symmetrical piles. The stone tiles are heated from beneath, and a faint, precise citrus scent lingers in the air.

**Private Quarters**
The door to this chamber is thicker than the rest - reinforced, not adorned. Inside the room is austere but immaculate. A dark wooden desk bare but for a single journal. Every edge sharp, every corner clean. A sealed cabinet hums with protective wards.

Dwarven Fortress of Axeholm
```
This is the restored version of the Dwarven Fortress of Axeholm, from DoIP.

The 1st and 2nd Floor have been restored to their original states with updated/restored decor, lighting, colors and details. 

This would make for a great Player HQ or plot point post-DoIP once it was liberated, and it could also be a great dwarven fortress in your homebrew game. 

The fortress itself boasts formidable defenses, a great hall, throne room, guard rooms, guard barracks, east/west halls, shrine, kitchen & storage, armory, forge, guest quarters, bath and leader's private chambers.

I hope you find it useful in your adventures!
