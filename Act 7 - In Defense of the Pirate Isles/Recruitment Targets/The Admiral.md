Approached by a well dressed man named Chetain . He informs the PCs that his captain would like to speak to them aboard his ship, which awaits at port. He doesn't know details, but knows that it's an offer for a mutually beneficial arrangement. He offers a small wooden chest with 20pp as a gift of solidarity.

[['Admiral' Nylora Monteiro]] is eager enough to meet the PCs on their ship or on land if they prefer, but will bring an honor guard.
"My well of loathing for Veriduna plumbs deeper than any other. But still rumors spread in my own home port. I wish these rumors squashed, but can't move against them directly as the public would take that as an admission and martyr them."
She wants the PCs the sail to [[Bloodwake Harbor]] and find proof of their ties/work if no proof is found - no loss.

The admirals coat is spotless if a bit threadbare. She crosses the room heels clicking across the floor and retrieves a parchment: a crude caricature of her smiling beneath an imperial flag. "This filth's on every streetlamp in Bloodwake. And if I were to lift a finger, why... that'd just prove them right wouldn't it."
"Y'alls not shackled by public opinion. Quite - loud I don't much give a damn."
"Clear my name sugar. I got a warfleet of the best trained sailors in these isles."

"Darlin' I don't take kindly to bein labeled a traitor."
"They're pourin poison in peoples ears and I can't even swat a fly without causing a scandal."

"My boys, they're loyal, don't sail for coward nor kings. They sail for me. If'n y'all bring me peace o' mind, they'll bring hellfire on the sea."

She says 'Veriduna' slow like it leaves a bad taste.


"The sea remembers every betrayal, so do I."
