Vessa Treen stands straight postured, having acquired a long coat that billows in the sea breeze. May begin with a searching look that quickly softens.

"I owe Kaelen everything for holding that line. But I owe you lot almost as much." *looks toward the horizon* (as if searching for sails) "You already have our answer, just tell us where to be."

"We remember who we are and who we're meant to be."

"You lot are family far as I'm concerned, carrying on Kaelen's legacy"
