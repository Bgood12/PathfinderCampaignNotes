**Setting?:** Most likely found upon her war galley The Mermaid's Corruption. She has various charts pinned to driftwood boards with knife pinned notes, the breeze whips through sail cloth awnings.


Thea greets the Jibblets with sharp eyes and wind-ruffled braids, hands inked from chart work.
"He laughed." flatly no emotion.
"Vorgash laughed when I laid out the fleet movements. Said no fleet in their right mind would sail the Maelstrom. He called it imperial bluffing."

"I've seen other reports. They've reinforced their hulls and shortened rigging."
"I'm moving my ships before the council realizes that we're at war, but I can't hold them alone."
She steps closer to the PCs
"You've made allies. People that trust you, people with no one else to follow. Go to them. Rally them. We need every available sail before the sea starts bleeding."


"Some empires are willing to drown half their army if it means planting a flag on a dock."
"They're not fools. They've seen our disunity. All they needed was an opening."

"The others may wait until Veriduna drops anchor in their own harbors. I'd rather sink the bastards before they make landfall."

"You've got more weight than you realize. Anyone you've saved, every ship you've put back in the water, that's a fleet waiting to be called."
