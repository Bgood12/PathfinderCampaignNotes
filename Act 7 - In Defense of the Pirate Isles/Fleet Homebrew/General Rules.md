Each fleet is comprised of squadrons, and each squadron is commanded by a commodore. The players will each take the role of one or more commodores for the naval combat portion.

### Squadron General Stats
**Commodore**: Commodore's Name
**Significant Characters**: Any other significant characters
**Special Abilities**: 
**Hits**: The cumulative number of hits that can be taken by ships in this squadron
- **Configuration**: How many hits each ship can take
**Morale**: Will of a squadron to keep fighting
**Maneuver**: Maneuverability of the squadron
**Armor Class**: How hard to hit a squadron
**Attack Value**: How good at hitting things is squadron
**Damage**: Damage dealt by the squadron
**Initiative**:  It's initiative

#### Morale Checks
Whenever a squadron takes any damage it must succeed a flat check or suffer a loss of morale. The base DC of this check is 10. If a squadron's morale reaches 0 it is routed and must spend all actions fleeing.
**Critical Success**: The squadron regains 1 morale limited by its starting value.
**Success**: Nothing happens.
**Failure**: The squadron loses 1 morale.
**Critical Failure**: The squadron loses 2 morale.

### Distance and Combat
A squadron may use a **Sail** action to attempt to become *Near* if *Distant*, *Near* if *Engaged*, or *Engaged* if *Near*. A squadron that is *Engaged* with two or more squadrons is *Outflanked* and takes a -2 penalty to AC. 

A Squadron can only use the *Fire the Cannons* action if it is at a *Near* distance; and can only use the *Boarding* action if it is *Engaged*.

### Taking Damage
When a squadron takes damage the defending commodore decides how it is distributed to their ships; unless otherwise specified.

Whenever a squadron takes any damage it must succeed a flat check or suffer a loss of morale. The base DC of this check is 10.

If a ship becomes disabled (reaches 0 hit points) the DC of morale checks for its squadron permanently increases by 1. This increase is applied prior to making the check caused by the triggering damage.

If a disabled ship takes damage the ship sinks and is unrecoverable. When this happens the DC of morale checks for its squadron permanently increases by 1. This increase is applied prior to making the check caused by the triggering damage.

#### Losing a Squadron
If all ships in a squadron are disabled, sunk, or routed the squadron is lost. When a squadron is lost the DC of morale checks made by all other squadrons permanently increases by 1.
