Lanterns burn bright on ships lashed together into a small floating city. The waves carry wreckage, the air fills with song. Someone has taken up a lute. They don't play well but no one seems to mind. The scents of salt and cheap rum permeate the floating city. Bottles and salted mead stand on barrels and crates.

*Let the PCs enjoy a bit of revelry of which Thea is notably missing*

The raucous crowd begins to hush rapidly like a wave. Emerging through the crowd [[Thea Varko]] drags the Veridunan admiral's banner through to where the bulk of leadership has congregated. She tosses the banner down with a wet slap.

```
Then Thea Varko steps forward. The room quiets.

“We came together when it mattered most. Not because someone told us to—but because these people—” she gestures to the PCs, “dared to do what our so-called Pirate King would not.”

“They intercepted the Veridunan fleet. They shattered it. They united the Free Isles when we needed it most. They bled for our freedom, as much as theirs.”

She turns, voice sharper now.

“And where was Vorgash Thrask?”

“Sitting on his throne, hoping the storm would do his job for him. Counting on wind and water to stop an empire. Complacent. Cowardly. Passive.”

“He is Pirate King in name only, not in deed. Not in fire. I will speak the truth that many here already feel **we can no longer follow him.**”

“I voice a vote of no confidence in Vorgash Thrask. We need new leadership—bold leadership. Pirate kings are chosen by deed, by daring, by **fame or infamy**. And I see no soul more worthy than those who led this defense.”

She turns to the party.

“They exposed Barthas Redmane for the traitor he was. They won the Regatta. And they forged the banner that rallied us all. They don’t just deserve the title **they’ve already earned it.**”

Murmurs ripple across the deck, then nods, then affirmations, some raucous, some solemn. A consensus begins to build like a wave.

Thea lifts her hand again, and silence falls once more.

“Make no mistake—Vorgash will not surrender the crown. And I’d wager blood before words will decide this.”

“If we let this fester, it’ll become a full on succession war between fleets, fought in every port. One that’ll tear the isles apart.”

“So I propose we end it quick.”

“We go to him. You lead. Our ships hold his in port. And when the tide recedes... we crown a king.”

[[Theodora 'Thea' Varko|Thea]] lauds the PCs leadership and initiative in intercepting and sundering the [[Veriduna|Veridunan]] armada. And for preserving the freedom of the isles with their daring venture.
She aldo damns the current [[Pirate King - Vorgash Thrask]]'s complacency and meekness which nearly brought about their collective doom. His passivity in hoping that natural barriers would protect them nearly spelt doom for all.

After her speech [[Theodora 'Thea' Varko|Thea]] voices a vote of no confidence, and declares that new leadership is needed. Pirate kings are chosen for boldness, fame/infamy, and success. Vorgash has demonstrated that he no longer possesses these qualities.

[[Theodora 'Thea' Varko|Thea]] puts forth that one of the PCs should rule as they united a coalition in defense of the isles, unmasked the traitorous [[Captain Barthas Redmane]], and won [[The Regatta]]. The others gathered will take up the call.

She will then call out that there can only be one pirate king and [[Pirate King - Vorgash Thrask|Vorgash]] is unlikely to surrender the title without a fight. Wanting to avoid a succession war [[Theodora 'Thea' Varko|Thea]] will recommend a direct assault on his fortress, with their assembled allies keeping his ships at bay.
