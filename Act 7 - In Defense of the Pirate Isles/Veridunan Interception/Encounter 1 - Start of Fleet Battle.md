Some devils and/or mages assault [[The Howling Jib]] in an attempt to disrupt the PC's fleet organization.

Leader of the boarding party places a Feather Token (Anchor) aboard [[The Howling Jib]] on arrival.
- If the Jibblets are unable to deal with the Anchor token the rest of the fleet must make a DC10 morale check or lose a point of morale
