A weathered wooden sign reading 'The Gilded Jasmine' hangs over the entrance of a shuttered tea house. The faint scent of steeped herbs lingers. The windows are heavily curtained - false, boarded up behind the drapes.

The front door is unlocked during daylight hours. A small bell rings when opened.


**Tea Room**
Appears abandoned with dust and scattered tea cups. A lone kettle sits upon a cold hearth.
- A thin line of dust ends near a book shelf on one wall.
- A pamphlet stuck in the floorboards reads "Treason in the Fog: How The Admiral Betrayed the Free Isles"

**Printing Room**
Rudimentary printing press.
- Wooden drawers full of slanderous pamphlets about The Admiral's past
- Satirical cartoons feature her crushing pirate ships underfoot among other things

**Office**
- Message from "L." instructing sharp escalation ahead of the next council meeting

**Storage**
Several crates of common trade goods, spices, tea, textiles, ink, etc.
- A poisoned crate intended for The Admiral's flagship labeled as 'Wine for the Quartermaster'
	- What poison?
