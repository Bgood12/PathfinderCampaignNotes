Species: Tiefling / Pronouns: she/her / age: 63

Basic Traits: Bat-Shit Crazy, Undying, Queen of the Sea (her words, not mine), Respected  Leader 

Jaq Harlow is a friend of the family. She was [[Mary Plateau|Mary’s]] captain for many years before Mary broke off to lead her own crew. Eventually Jaq followed her footsteps and backed out of pirating, instead offering her services as a privateer. To this day she is a highly respected ship captain but also has a reputation for being a tad bit unhinged. Many say she should’ve died a long time ago but rumor has it she made a deal with a sea witch for immortality (even though she’s clearly still aging).

Fun facts:
1. Jaq claims to have never lost a coin flip, [[Leaklan Plateau|Leaklen]] has never seen her lose
2. Jaq is quite wealthy and could retire if she wanted to… she just doesn't want to.
