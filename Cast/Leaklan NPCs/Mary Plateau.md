Mary Plateau is the mother of [[Leaklan Plateau|Leaklen]]. She is a strong fiery red head and retired sailor. In her heyday, Mary was the first mate and quartermaster to [[Jaq (Jack) Harlow|Captain Jaq Harlow]] before later hanging up her pirate hat. She then became a privateer who was hired to escort a group of researchers, one of whom was [[Louis (loo-wee) Plateau|Louis Plateau]]. Mary and Louis sailed together for years, studying and researching the ocean together, eventually leading to a strong romantic relationship. A decade later, she was forced into retirement after a nasty accident at sea took both of her legs. She may be wheelchair bound, but she hasn’t lost her fiery attitude and honesty just gives her an excuse to focus on her arm workouts. She now passes her days as a Dock Master, monitoring the ships coming and going. Mary doesn’t know that Leaklen left with Professor Clover and thought he went with Jaq.
