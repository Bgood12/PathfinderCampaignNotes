**Mivalis**: meh-vaal-ee

At 33, Mivalis has become a master ranger and skilled archer, using his abilities to help his community flourish. As the shepherd of Sotiría, he is tasked with taming and tending to a wide variety of sea creatures. Most notably, he works closely with hippocampi, training them to aid in hunting, transportation, and in the rare defense of Sotiría from potential threats. His bond with these creatures is deep and mutual, a symbol of his dedication to both his people and the natural world. 

Mivalis is known for his steady hand with a bow, often using it to hunt or protect the sea life he tends to. While some may see him as a simple shepherd, those who know him understand that Mivalis is a guardian of the ocean’s delicate balance, ensuring that Sotiría remains in harmony with the creatures of the deep. 

His quiet strength and compassion make him a respected figure in Sotiría, and his skills with both animals and a bow make him an invaluable protector. Despite his vital role, Mivalis remains humble, preferring the company of the creatures he cares for over the bustling life of the city. Yet, whenever the city faces danger, he is always ready to defend it.
