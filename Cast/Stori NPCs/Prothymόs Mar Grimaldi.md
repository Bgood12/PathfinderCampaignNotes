**Prothymόs Mar Grimaldi**
< Title First Last >
LVL 12: Magus, Nobleman, 144 years old

< Prothymόs - liege, sir (pro-thee-mos) >
< Mar - (m-are) >

Mar is a cornerstone of leadership in Sotiria, serving as the patriarch of the community’s
gracious Grimaldi family. Alongside his wife, Nereida, Mar has helped shape their
people’s destiny through a combination of strength, wisdom, and unwavering
commitment to their well-being. His expertise and noble heritage have forged him into a
figure of respect and authority.

From an early age, Mar was groomed for leadership within the noble circles of Thalikó
society. His training encompassed a broad array of disciplines, from the arcane to the
practical. As an experienced magus, Mar possesses a deep and versatile knowledge of
magic, granting him the ability to harness elemental forces and weave powerful spells
that protect and empower his community. His magical prowess is complemented by his
skills in hunting and survival, honed through years of navigating the treacherous
underwater landscapes and ensuring the safety and sustenance of his people.

Mar’s training extended beyond the magical and the martial; he is also a master of
diplomacy and defense. His ability to negotiate and forge alliances has been crucial in
maintaining peace and security for Sotiría. His strategic mind and tactical acumen have
proven invaluable in planning defenses and responding to threats. Mar’s experience in
war and defense is rooted in a personal history of facing and overcoming numerous
challenges that have threatened his people.

The attack on Katoikía, which forced the Thalikó to flee and sever ties with the outside
world, was a turning point for Mar. He played a pivotal role in orchestrating the
evacuation and ensuring the safety of his people all while caring for and protecting his
pregnant wife. Despite his brave leadership, the experience was still deeply traumatic.
The loss of their home and the subsequent need for a hidden refuge highlighted both
the vulnerability and resilience of his community.

As Mar continues to lead alongside Nereida, his focus remains on ensuring the safety
and prosperity of their community. His commitment to his family and his people drives
him to remain vigilant and prepared, ready to confront any challenge that may arise
while striving to protect the peace his wife so dearly values.


**Mar and Astoria** 
Mar has a deep, close bond with his daughter, Astoria. From a young age, Astoria was
taught by Mar to embrace the skills of magic, self-defense, and survival. Her father’s
lessons were not just about practical abilities but also about understanding the
responsibilities that come with power. Mar’s approach was to instill in Astoria a sense of
duty and the importance of using one’s skills for the greater good. She has learned
much of her fighting style from him and uses what he taught her regularly to keep
enemies at bay.
