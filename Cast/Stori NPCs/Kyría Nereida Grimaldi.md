**Kyría Nereida Grimaldi**
< Title First Last >
LVL 12: Psychic, Healer, 140 years old

< Kyría - madam, milady (keer-ee-uh) >
< Nereida - (nur-eh-duh) >

Nereida is the heart and soul of her underwater community. Together with her husband,
Mar, she has guided their people through it all.

Trained in the ancient arts of healing and meditation, she became a master of using
psychic crystals to mend wounds, soothe troubled minds, and restore balance to her
people. Her deep connection with the ocean and its energies allowed her to perform
miracles of healing, earning her the respect and admiration of her community.

Her approach to leadership has always been deeply rooted in her pacifist beliefs.
Nereida firmly believes that peace and compassion are the highest forms of strength,
and she has dedicated her life to avoiding conflict whenever possible. Her skills in
diplomacy and mediation are renowned, and she has successfully negotiated disputes
and maintained harmony within her community and beyond. This peaceful philosophy
has shaped Sotiría into a sanctuary of tranquility, where conflicts are resolved through
understanding rather than force.

Nereida continues her work as a healer and diplomat, striving to maintain the delicate
balance of her peaceful community. Her life is a testament to the power of empathy and
the belief that even in the face of adversity, harmony and compassion can prevail.


**Nereida and Astoria**
Nereida’s close relationship with her daughter, Astoria, is a source periodic tension.
While Nereida supports Astoria and deeply cares for her, she struggles with her
daughter’s willingness to confront potential threats head-on. The differences in their
approaches have occasionally led to friction, as Astoria’s pursuit of answers and action
sometimes conflicts with Nereida’s desire to avoid conflict and maintain peace. Despite
these differences, the bond between them remains strong. Nereida hopes that through
her example, she can guide Astoria toward a balance between action and diplomacy. To
help achieve this, Nereida has trained Astoria in scholarly and introspective subjects,
like healing and meditation. She believes that their differing perspectives can ultimately
strengthen their community and that Astoria’s passion and drive, tempered with
compassion and understanding, will lead to a future where peace and justice can
coexist.
