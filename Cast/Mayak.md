Mayak Lizardfolk Liberator Champion Deity Besmara (The Pirate Queen) Mayak was born and raised in a small costal village of lizardfolk as a deckhand for many years and on many ships. After proving himself as a reliable armory ward, he found himself on The Crimson Key crewed by Besmara's Liberators. A ship with the sole purpose of stopping slave ships. Mayak was inspired by the crew and took an oath to Besmara (The Pirate Queen) and joined the boarding party. After 2 years of successful boardings and raids, The Crimson Key had some bad luck with a ship willing to go down with her. A few barrels of black powder later, both ships caught fire and were eventually taken by the sea. Thanks to Mayak's ancestry, he was barely able to swim to shore alive. Believing he is the last survivor of his ship, Mayak continues the work of The Crimson Key by liberating those who need or want it.
