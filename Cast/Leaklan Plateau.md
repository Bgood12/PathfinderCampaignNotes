Leaklen Plateau, born to parents Mary and Louis Plateau, was the definition of average. He grew up in a middle class home and was never the strongest, smartest or most cunning. His mother was a shipwright and his father was a clergyman. Mary Plateau was as smart as she was strong and she helped instill a passion for knowledge and helping others in Leaklen. Louis Plateau was a devotee of Desna, the goddess of luck and dreams, and taught Leaklen the importance of stories and adventure. But the thing that had stuck with Leaklen the longest, is the story of Atlantis (a city of great treasure and history lost to time) his parents told him as a bedtime story. He fell in love with the story of Atlantis and has made it his life long dream to be the one to discover Atlantis. All of this accumulated in a love and passion for archaeology and on his 16th birthday, he got a job working for a local museum.

3 years pass and Leaklen is now the assistant museum manager. A crew of shifty folks calling themselves “adventurers” came to the museum seeking a scholar to help them decrypt a map that would lead them to a colony city believed to be a part of the Atlantean society. The museum director was growing too frail to make such a perilous journey, so Leaklen very enthusiastically volunteered to go in his stead. Cut to a few days later, Leaklen has been growing very suspicious of the crew as he doesn’t believe they were being very truthful about their true intentions. They eventually arrive at the island and after making their way through a forest, they find the long lost temple. Making their way through the temple proves deadly, as many of the crew are picked off by traps and ancient protectors. Less than half the crew remains as they enter the heart of the crypt. There, Leaklen finds an ancient artifact that was left by the previous inhabitants of the crypt, but upon touching the artifact, it releases a  strange magic that starts to turn the crew remnants into fish/human monsters! Leaklen struggles and fights to escape the temple and does so, but he hadn’t realized he was still holding onto the artifact… and he was now part fish!

Using the dinghy he rowed his way to the nearest island where he meets Ethan’s character or something like that lol I’ll have to talk to Ethan about how or if we still wanna incorporate that.
