"Yllavyre" means "The patient storm" in the Fey language. And "Enallynna" means "Nature's arbiter."

Yllavyre Enallyna introduces himself as “Ylla” (pronounced ee-luh). He goes by any pronouns. He’s a 19 year old human. He was born to a nomadic circle of druids of the Storm Order. He lived a very simple, peaceful life, travelling the countryside with his circle of friends and family, as druids, they did all they could to nurture the health of the wilderness. 
Ylla’s tribe was attacked in the night. In the chaos, one druid hid him beneath an illusion spell, so the raiders couldn’t find him and kill him. When the attack was over, Ylla emerged and found his entire druid circle was either dead or missing. He picked up a sword left on the battlefield by one of the defeated raiders. The sword was a “Kalis” sword.

So Ylla spent about two months wandering aimlessly, trying to process the trauma and also looking for the raiders. After those two months, Ylla found Leaklen washed ashore. The two of them got to know each other a little bit. Ylla explained he wanted to find someone to get revenge, and Leaklen explained he wanted a cure for his curse. So they both had reason to travel the world and figured they could go together. 

**Ylla’s father: Luceran Enallyna.** 
He is from a circle of Storm Order druids. Luceran taught Ylla everything he knows about medicine, religion, survival, and nature.
**Ylla’s mother: Miaphyra Dreymarra.** 
Miaphyra Dreymarra. She was a knight from Ezkardia. She met Luceran while he was in the city during a festival and they fell in love there. They got married and eventually had Ylla. Miaphyra taught Ylla about acrobatics, athletics, and weapon-fighting.
**Ylla’s older brother: [[World Building/Countries/Pirate Confederacy (Avarian Archipelago)/NPCs/The Windrider|Sylro Enallyna]].** 
Ylla was 13 years old when Sylro was 21. At 21 years old, Sylro left the circle of the druids on bad terms. Sylro was always disinterested in being a druid and left to pursue his own path. Ylla was told that Sylro was summoned by the high council of druids to work in a different circle. But Ylla could tell that Sylro probably quit druidic practices altogether. 
**Ylla’s childhood best friend: Reyrieth.** 
She was also a druid of the storm order. Ylla was always introverted and not inclined to draw attention to himself, especially with the drama always around his brother. Reyrieth, the extrovert, helped make Ylla feel like an individual. They did normal druid childhood stuff together like play games and practice cantrips.

Prior to Ylla’s goal becoming avenge the death of his circle, he didn’t really have huge ambitions other than to help his circle take care of nature. But now he is out in the wild and equipped with a weapon that helped kill his family and friends. He wields it as a way to confront his trauma rather than try to escape it. And he wields it because he wants the small piece of revenge that comes from using a weapon that was made for evil as a force for good.

**Ylla's internal belief statements:** 
- "The world is a cruel place, but I must try to lessen its cruelty." 
- "The ends justify the means." 
- "I have nothing left to lose." 
- "I can't get emotionally attached to anyone in case I lose them." 
- "I thought my purpose was to care for nature. Now I know my purpose is to get vengeance for my circle."
