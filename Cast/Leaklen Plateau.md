### Early Life:
 Leaklen “Leaky” Plateau was born 19 years ago (from the year our story takes place) in the city of [[Illurum]], to [[Mary Plateau|Mary]] and [[Louis (loo-wee) Plateau|Louis]] Plateau. Ever since he was born, Leaklen has been a very sickly child. He had been born with many severe allergies to very common things as well as having a genetic condition that weakened his lungs. With his conditions, Leaklen was bound to the confines of his home for most of his life and would often have a very runny nose which is where the nickname “Leaky” came from. His father, being a scholar and retired archaeologist, homeschooled Leaklen which instilled in him a love of knowledge and learning. His mother, being a retired sailor, told him stories of the world outside the city and his home which instilled in him his love for adventure and romance. 
### Growing Up In [[Illurum]]:
 The city of Illuris is a hub for trade and travel meaning many different kinds of people pass through the city all the time. One of Leaklen’s dreams has always been to be an adventurer like the many he's seen passing through Illuris. One of those adventurers was a family friend named Cpt [[Jaq (Jack) Harlow |Jaq Harlow]], an ex pirate turned privateer that his mother sailed with for many years. Leaklen really had no friends (being bound to his home and all) but he did have 1, the son of [[Jaq (Jack) Harlow |Jaq Harlow]], [[Joseph (Sephy) Harlow|Joseph Harlow]]. Joseph is a year older than Leaklen but they became very close friends. One day when Joseph had come to visit, he brought a new book he had picked up for Leaklen, a book about a Lost City that would change Leaklen’s life forever.
### Young Adulthood: 
As he aged, Leaklen’s condition began to get better to the point he could actually leave the house for extended periods of time. Around 15, Leaklen got a job at the museum his father curates. He began as the dusting boy, but eventually began to learn more and more about the artifacts within the museum and was then promoted to junior researcher by 16. Leaklen began to research the Lost City but the senior archeologists told him that the story was just a fairytale, but this didn't stop Leaklen from trying to locate it. He spent the next few years fruitlessly trying to find the lost city, when one day a stranger came to the museum. 
### Bringing us to today: 
The stranger was a scholar named [[Professor Clover]] from a far off land and was planning a voyage to an island he thought might lead to the Lost City and needed help decrypting the map. Leaklen’s peers laughed at the idea but Leaklen was convinced and he helped [[Professor Clover]] decrypt his map, revealing the location of an island called Lodestar. He had to sail on this voyage so he could prove this wasn't just an old sailor’s tale. His parents forbade him going on the voyage, but told him if he wished, he could make his first voyage with [[Jaq (Jack) Harlow|Cpt Jaq]] who was preparing for a 3 day voyage to a nearby trade city. Leaklen was too stubborn to listen, so he lied to his parents, saying he was leaving with Jaq but instead hopped on board[[Professor Clover| Professor Clover’s]] ship.

The voyage was a smooth ride, not even a storm raged during the week long journey. The crew eventually landed on the island of Lodestar. The island seemed like a remote jungle island, except for the clearly man made structures on the island. The crew followed a path towards a small building that was partially sticking out of the earth. Eventually, they opened the doors revealing a tunnel carved with incredible craftsmanship. Opening the doors also unleashed a strange pinging noise echoing from deeper in the tunnel. Excited by their discovery, they continued through the tunnel toward the light on the other side. 

The crew was not ready for what they discovered. The tunnel had led them to some sort of temple, carved deep into the earth. The temple (pictured below) was an incredible sight. The crew immediately began to search the area to find what they could discover, but because Leaklen couldn't get the sound of the ping out of his head he decided to follow it. It led him into the central building, a beautiful grand library.in the middle of the room, there was an incredibly ornate display case holding…

The Book. 

He instantly knew it was calling to him (it wasn't). That's what the ping must be, the Book is calling out to him (it's not)!! It's just like in all the stories! This is my call to adventure!! Leaklen fiddles with the locks, undoing each seal until the case opens and…

Leaklen takes the book.

Suddenly the entire chamber housing the temple began to shake. The carvings lining every wall begin to glow a bright aqua blue. Leaklen’s hand is beginning to change and in his panic he hides the book and darts out of the temple. The other crew mates are changing as well. One has a bulbous catfish head, another’s neck begins to extend like a moray eel. Leaklen can feel his body changing as well so he runs as fast as he can towards the exit, but his lungs begin to fail as he nears his goal. He collapses, unconscious, the next time he awakens, Leaklen is drifting at sea. His clothes are ripped and most of his supplies are gone, but he still has the Book. Surprisingly he's able to swim to a nearby island, where he learns his body has been transmogrified. He now has a hulking body and traits akin to a shark. Over the next few days, Leaklen’s anxieties eat away at him as he tries to figure out what to do. He decides that he needs to bring this book back to his father, but he can't return to his current state, so Leaklen seeks out the help of [[Ima Ental]] to try and break the curse on his body. But Leaklen lies about the truth of what happened:
### Leaklen’s Story:
 All of the events play out as normal, however it is [[Professor Clover]] that follows the ping to the central library. Clover eventually is maddened by the book and breaks it out of its encasing which causes the transformations and the collapse. 

(was the pinging coming from the book? Idk, my theory is that it was just a leak dripping and echoing through the chamber, but who knows…)
