**Backstory**:
Astoria was born into the reclusive undersea territory of Sotiría under dire circumstances – on
the heels of a devastating attack on their former home of Katoikía that left her surviving kin
traumatized and barely settled into their new enclave. She quickly grew alongside her
community, amidst its coral spires and bioluminescent gardens that swayed with the currents.

Given the rarity and unfortunate history of her type, most female aquatic elves, or Thalikó as
they are known, settle down quickly and quietly in order to prevent the extinction of their kind. Astoria, however, wasn’t interested in that lifestyle. The lone child of her family and first-born in her community, she instead became the first and only female hunter-gatherer of the clan. She decided her purpose was to provide for those that already existed, a decision motivated by the weight of her people's tragic history upon her shoulders.

The daughter of Sotiría’s rulers, Astoria’s reputation preceded her. She was primed from a
young age by her father, Mar, and mother, Nereida, to take on significant responsibilities and
uphold the traditions of her people. She never let her status get to her head, especially as she
matured. If anything, she was humble, knowing she owed her community a great deal of love
and care for dedicating their lives to Sotiría’s prosperity, a sacrifice that kept her safe from her infancy into adulthood.

As such, much of Astoria’s life has been spent providing for her neighbors and protecting them from possible threats. Any ill-doer who crossed her path was sucked in by her charm and subsequently dealt with by her wrath. Astoria, while seemingly gentle on the exterior, had a mean streak saved solely for those who dared to wrong her or the ones she swore to defend. This was met with a loathsome attitude by her mother, the community’s healer who has spent years patching up wounds and saving lives threatened by the hands of violence. Despite her mother’s wishes to not become cold and violent, Astoria could not help but let her strength do the talking in times where she must assert her dominance.

Astoria's most recent journeys have been inspired by an honorable quest given to her by her
father -- find the remnants of a sacred trident with the power to turn the tides. This trident and its power is the key to keeping their new home safe, and without it, survival has been harder than ever before. Luckily, Astoria is persistent and will stop at nothing, even looking death in the eye, to ensure her family and community can live in peace for eternity.

In recent past, Astoria heard whisperings of an artifact fitting the trident’s description and has
since been on the prowl for more information. This has led her to board a ship named The
Evangeline under the guise of free labor / transaction with a few sailors.

Now, she embarks on a perilous adventure across vast waters in search of clues about her lost treasure and the motive of the man that led to Katoikía’s demise. Her quest is not only about reclaiming a lost artifact but also about restoring her community’s pride and ensuring that their legacy is not forgotten. The path ahead is fraught with peril, but Astoria’s resolve remains unshaken as she dives deeper into the shadows of the past to secure a brighter future for her people.
