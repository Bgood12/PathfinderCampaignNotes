Louis Plateau is the father of [[Leaklen Plateau|Leaklen]]. He’s a quiet and studious man with short blonde hair. Louis is the head Curator of the [[Illurum]] Museum and a respected archaeologist. He spent a lot of his youth searching for a grand discovery that would put him in the history books forever, but he was never successful. Louis is best known for his work with ancient linguistics, deciphering lost or difficult to translate languages. Louis was the biggest influence on Leaklen’s life, being both his father and his teacher. He instilled a love of learning and curiosity in Leaklen and taught him all of his academic knowledge (Leaklen was never as good at learning languages as his father though). Louis eventually retired from field research and settled down in [[Illurum]] with [[Mary Plateau|Mary]], taking the job as museum curator and research consultant. Louis doesn’t know that Leaklen is not with [[Jaq (Jack) Harlow|Jaq]].
