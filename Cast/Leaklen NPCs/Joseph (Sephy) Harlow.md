Joseph Harlow is [[Leaklen Plateau|Leaklen’s]] only true childhood friend. He knew of the other children but rarely if ever interacted with them. Sephy, however, is the son of [[Jaq (Jack) Harlow|Jaq]] who worked closely with [[Mary Plateau|Leaklen’s mother]] so the two basically grew up together. They would both spend hours reading adventure novels and comics about all of the cool adventurers. Their favorite being about an older series about a man named [[The Commodore]], a fearsome sailor who led a small naval fleet of other adventurers he had pulled under his wings. The two both wanted to grow up to be just like [[The Commodore]], but Leaklen’s physicality kept him down. Most kids were much stronger than Leaklen due to his condition, but Sephy was unusually strong for their age. As they aged, Leaklen let go of wanting to be like The Commodore. He knew he wasn't built for that, but Sephy’s body had caught up to their strength and now they’re built like a brick shit house. Leaklen has instead set his mind to helping his friend reach that dream for both of them.

Fun Facts:
1. Leaklen and Jaq are the only 2 people allowed to call Joseph, “Sephy”. For everyone else, they prefer Joseph or Jo.
2. Joseph’s favorite game from his childhood is tetherball and they’re still really good at it.
