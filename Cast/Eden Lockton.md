Eden was born to a wealthy minor "nobility" family and showed a talent for magic at a young age. Her parents sent her at around 8 years old to study magic at a prestigious school. While there she secretly studied dark magic. In her teens she was found out and they expelled her from the school. Since then she has been travelling and learning more about necromancy and dark magic. She is sure her family knows of her expulsion from the school but she has not seen them since and she does regret that. She has relationships with some of her acquaintances from the school, both good and bad.

 The magic school Eden attended is not near but not incredibly far either. It has only been about 4 or 5 years so she probably didn't travel clear across the world in that time. She is originally from pretty far away. The school was not near her home. 

Pursuit of knowledge is her primary motivator. She is also somewhat motivated by the want to prove the school wrong and use her witchcraft for good.

Her familiar is a weasel which is the symbol of her families house.

Her father was a wizard who helped the king with something (open to suggestions based on your world's lore) maybe helped in a war or quelled an uprising, and he was rewarded with a noble position. The family has always been wealthy and influential, but the nobility was a gift from the king or Lord or whoever. That is why her parents sent her to magic school and pressed her to be good at magic. It's kinda part of the family legacy and the royalty expects the family to produce powerful children.

#### Relationships
- A professor named Ozar helped Eden by providing her with access to learning resources in dark magic because he believes all information is neither good or bad, it is neutral. He also defended her at the hearing for her expulsion but ultimately had to back up the decision of the school. She has not contacted him since so as not to get him in trouble.
- Eden does not have a good relationship with the headmaster of the school.
- She also has a rivalry with the other student who turned her in. Jade? I am picturing a male character as the student who turned her in. Eden has mostly friendly to frenemy type relationships with others at the school. I would not say she has any outright enemies, although Jade could potentially become an enemy. Or a friend, if he has changed.
- She had a good friend, Aliyah, but she also has not spoken to her since she left the school.
- Eden has an older brother, named Erick, who is a wizard that she does occasionally communicate with and I imagine her parents would receive information through him as to her general well-being. Eden does send him letters when she's in a town where that would be an option.
- She has younger siblings but she does not communicate with them mainly out of guilt for leaving without saying anything.
