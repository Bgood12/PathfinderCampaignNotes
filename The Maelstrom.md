### Description
A massive plume of water erupting from the oceans surface. The water from the eruption carries in the wind drastically increasing rainfall in the nearby [[Saharan Rainforest]]. The displacement from this sub-aquatic mega-geyser creates a constant tsunami effect for nearly 250 miles.


### History
The Maelstrom was created when a portal to the elemental plane of water was opened in the ancient capital city of the [[Zirnitra | Zirnitran]] civilization. 

The nearby [[Pirate Confederacy]] hosts an annual race around the fixture.
