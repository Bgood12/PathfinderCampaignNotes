### Appearance
Finnick is a stocky dwarf with a wild look in his eyes. He has dark brown hair with grey streaks tied back into a short pony tail. His hands are perpetually smudged with grease, gunpowder, and soot, and he wears a leather apron that has been patched a dozen times. Finnick's hands and fingers are adorned with many small burns. He adorns a perpetual wide and toothy grin - especially when things are exploding around him.

### Personality
Finnick is a maniacally fanatical artillerist obsesses with anything that goes 'boom'. He's very protective of his cannons, referring to them as his children and giving each a unique name. He spends hours tweaking (calibrating) each cannon. He is loyal to [[Captain Vanessa Lycander]] believing that her leadership gives him the freedom to pursue his 'art'.

### Quirks
- **Talking to Cannons:** Finnick talks to his cannons as if they were people. He gives each one a name and compliments them on successful shots.
- **Explosive Laughter** which echoes throughout the ship.
