#### Quartermaster - Dara "Deadeye" Halford (Female, Human)
Dara is a grizzled, scarred veteran with one milky, blind eye, the result of a shipboard mutiny in her youth. Despite her intimidating appearance, she’s calm, cool-headed, and often the voice of reason aboard the ship. She keeps careful watch over the ship’s stores and is the one who settles disputes among the crew, making her someone who values fairness above all else.

#### Master-at-arms/Firstmate - Garrick Volund (Male, Half-orc)
Garrick is a hulking, broad-shouldered man with a thick beard and a prosthetic iron arm that replaces the one he lost in a boarding skirmish. His arm has been fashioned into a weapon of sorts, often used to intimidate others. He’s blunt, straightforward, and fiercely protective of the crew, but he has a no-nonsense approach to discipline and combat training.

DC 28 Performance check can crack his aloof demeanor.

#### Navigator - Nyla "Star-y" Damaris (Female, Half-elf)
Nyla is a young, sharp-eyed half-elf with platinum hair. She’s always fascinated by the stars, using them as her guide even on the stormiest of nights. Nyla is soft-spoken and introspective, often lost in thought, with a deep love for the mysteries of the cosmos and the sea.

#### Doctor - "Doc" Miri Pebblefoot (Female, Gnome)
Miri is a lively and energetic gnome with wild, curly red hair and bright, inquisitive eyes behind her spectacles. She’s always got a smile on her face. Despite her small size, she’s confident and efficient in her work, moving around the sickbay with boundless energy. She’s a bit eccentric, humming while she works and chatting to herself (or her patients) with a playful and positive attitude.

#### Carpenter - Silas "Sawtooth" Quinn (Male, Human)
Silas is a wiry man with a perpetual smirk and several missing teeth, earning him his nickname. His hands are always covered in wood shavings or grease, and he’s constantly tinkering with something. He’s quick-witted and enjoys cracking jokes, but he takes great pride in the ship’s structure and repairs.

#### Cook - Olga "Sharkbait" Bronson (Female, Half-Orc)
A stout woman with a larger-than-life personality, Olga is missing an eye, which she claims she lost during a shark attack after falling overboard. She has a rough-and-tumble sense of humor and loves to tease the crew while she cooks up hearty meals. Her food is simple but filling, and she’s always experimenting with whatever ingredients are available.

#### Lookout - Tevin Morro (Male, Half-elf)
Tevin is a lanky half-elf with wild hair, a nervous energy, and keen eyes that miss nothing from his perch high up in the crow’s nest. He’s constantly scanning the horizon and rarely comes down unless he has to. Tevin is a bit jittery and anxious, but his vigilance keeps the ship safe.

#### Bosun - Arn "Grumbles" Torvald (Male, Dwarf)
Arn is a stout dwarf with a permanent scowl and a gravelly voice that commands authority. He’s responsible for the ship’s day-to-day upkeep and makes sure the crew is pulling their weight. He’s strict, demanding, and gruff, but his experience and loyalty to the ship are unquestionable.

#### Rigger - "Spider" Quinn Jossel (Male, Human)
Quinn is a slender, nimble human who earned his nickname from his uncanny ability to climb the ship’s rigging with spider-like ease. He’s always grinning and rarely stays in one place for long. Quinn is a trickster, pulling pranks and telling tall tales, though his skill in maintaining the sails and rigging is unmatched.

DC 23 Performance to match his tall tales and jokes. Make fast friends by pulling a prank with him.
