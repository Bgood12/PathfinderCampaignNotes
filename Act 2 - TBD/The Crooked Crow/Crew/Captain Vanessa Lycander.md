### Backstory
Vanessa Lycander was born into a life of luxury in the bustling port city of **Illurum**, where her family was part of the city’s wealthy merchant class. Her parents, strict and overbearing, had carefully charted a course for her future that involved marrying into another powerful family and managing their growing mercantile empire. But Vanessa wasn’t interested in the life they’d planned for her. She craved adventure and freedom, and she couldn’t stand the rigid expectations her family had placed upon her.

At the age of 17, Vanessa fled aboard a merchant vessel, securing herself a position as a navigator. For several years, she honed her skills as a navigator and seafarer, but the merchant life still felt too restrictive for her. When she encountered a crew of pirates, the thrill of their lawless freedom was too much to resist, and she left behind her past life for good.

After some time serving as a pirate, Vanessa met her future husband, [[Captain Erfried Lycander]], another pirate captain. They became co-captains, leading their crew together for several years. Eventually her husband revealed that he and two other pirate captains recovered a tablet from a dragon that can access a treasure hoard. Vanessa killed Erfried hoping to claim the treasure herself. The gunshot that rang out triggered a mutiny. Vanessa put down the mutiny with ruthless efficiency, cementing her reputation as a dangerous, capable leader who wouldn’t hesitate to kill to protect her ship and her power.
