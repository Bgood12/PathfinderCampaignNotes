The Siren’s Call, a partially sunken, decaying ship lying in a tranquil cove. Much of the ship is underwater, wedged into a coral outcropping, while the top of the main mast just barely breaks the water’s surface. 

As the PCs approach, they spot the **Siren’s Call** wedged against jagged coral, her once-proud masts now leaning at precarious angles, breaching the waterline. Her hull bears the scars of a violent wreck, with splintered wood and torn sails waving softly in the underwater currents. Barnacles and algae have just begun to take hold on the surface.

In the calm, clear waters of the cove, they can see shoals of fish darting around the wreck, as the occasional glint of something metallic flashes from below. The entrance to the captain’s quarters is accessible through a cracked porthole or a jagged break in the hull, leading down to where a **giant octopus** has made itself at home.


**Encounter Setup**:
- **Giant Octopus**: The octopus, drawn by the safety of the enclosed quarters and the ample supply of fish sheltering in the wreck, is territorial and immediately hostile. Sensing the PCs’ approach through the water’s vibrations, it positions itself defensively, ready to strike at anything that enters.
- **Environment Hazards**: The ship’s interior is cramped, and visibility is still somewhat limited. Sharp splinters of broken wood jut from the walls, while overturned furniture and tangled ropes drift eerily in the water. The octopus uses these obstacles to its advantage, lashing out from behind barriers and retreating into the shadows.

**Loot**
Among the debris of the captain's quarters—moldy maps, a tarnished sextant, and ruined books—they’ll find the **tablet piece** hidden in an iron box, weighted down with stones. The box has corroded over time, so a bit of prying may be necessary to open it, revealing the stone tablet within, worn but intact.
