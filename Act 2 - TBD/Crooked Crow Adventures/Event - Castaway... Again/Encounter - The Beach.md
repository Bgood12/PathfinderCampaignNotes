The only sandy beach on [[Ebbclaw Isle]] is accessible via a lagoon beyond a coral reef. Upon approach the party may hear shouting in the sea elf language, yelling something like 'get back'. After gaining a visual the party will see two sea predators ( #todo ) cornering a hippocampus on the beach. While a sea elf riding a second hippocampus in the lagoon takes pot shots with a crossbow to peel one of the predators off.

If aided she will explain that the hippocampi were grazing on nearby undersea kelp when the predators descended upon them.
