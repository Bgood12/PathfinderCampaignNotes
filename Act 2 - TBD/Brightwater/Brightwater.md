Brightwater is a bustling, vibrant town located on one of the smaller pirate isles. The town is known for its welcoming atmosphere, thanks to its origins as a settlement founded by freed slaves from [[Balaika]], prior to the country's independence. The town’s culture is deeply intertwined with the worship of Cayden Cailean, known as "The Lucky Drunk," and every year, the townspeople celebrate their freedom with a grand religious festival.

The town of Brightwater resides on a curve of shoreline of a largish isle. A series of small well-made wooden bridges connect the larger town to a smaller island with a deep water cove. The town is made of of small well-made wooden buildings. Currently many of the towns building and bridges are decorated with festive palm fronds and flowers. The shallower sea between the two islands houses many small ships, while the larger oceangoing vessels use the smaller islands piers or lie anchored farther out in the harbor.
