**Entering [[Sotiría]]**
The Jibblets approach the mouth of a vast underwater volcanic caldera. The water is warmer here, stemming from heated currents gently swirling from the seabed. Just beyond the rim natural coral growths twist and arch over one another creating pastel structures. 

You're led through narrow channels between them invisible to the untrained eye. As you navigate through the coral, bioluminescent polyps blink into vision like stars. 

The settlement pulses with light from the bioluminescent flora lining structures and the glowing kelp forests that stretch along the pathways swaying faintly in the currents.

As you traverse you see several sea elves entering and exiting structures that seem to be built into the coral formations.

The Jibblets are met with strange (wary) glances which seem to be eased a bit by Stori's presence.


**[[Prothymόs Mar Grimaldi]] Reaction**
Personally proud of Stori for killing Redmane, may have some reservations about how it was done as leader of the community

"You carry more than a head, Astoria-you carry the weight of a long past. You have done what many cannot... and I am proud. Though I must consider what events this may set in motion."


**[[Kyría Nereida Grimaldi]] Reaction**
Wishes the Redmane situation was resolved without the need for violence, also low-key proud of Stori

"His death, as much as it may bring relief, was a dangerous act. There are always consequences to violence. While I am proud of you I do wish the situation had been resolved without bloodshed. You've grown far more than we could have imagined. I just want you to understand the weight of your choices"


**Public Service Announcement**
[[Prothymόs Mar Grimaldi]] addresses the Thalico about the deaths of [[Captain Barthas Redmane|Redmane]] and [[Elias Voss]].

"People of Sotiria we swim not only in the shadow of the reef, but also in a the light of a new reprisal. Many still live in fear of the pirate who butchered our kin, others still bear the weight of silence and secrecy. 
The pirate lays dead not by vengeance alone, but by the clarity of purpose of my daughter Astoria and her companions. They risked much, not only to protect what remains but to ensure that his shadow does not darken the next tide. The betrayer in turn lays dead at the pirate's hand.
With this truth also comes troubling knowledge. The empire of Veriduna holds the trident. Though we are safe beneath this reef the world shifts. Let this news not reach your heart with fear but with calm resolve.
And let us give thanks to those who still act with courage when the surface stirs."
