Keys to the prison are with the master at arms

The dark filthy prison is split into cells, manacles hang from the walls and the floor is covered in moldering straw.

Two prisoners currently
- Dahlia Stararrow
	- Tall, thin, human woman lacking two hands, a tongue, and blinded via a hot poker.
	- Former friend of [[Captain Barthas Redmane|Redmane]] who though their friendship would protect her from his wrath when she spoke out against his current machinations
- Sanza Klaus
	- Older human man, formerly heavyset with a white beard, missing a foot and had one eye pierced with a hot poker
		- Former rigger aboard the Emberwake
		- [[Captain Barthas Redmane|Redmane]] blamed his performance for losing  [[The Regatta]]


#### Torture Room
Pairs of iron manacles line one of the walls, all spattered with dried blood. Metal racks around the room hold bizarre arrays of torture implements including, spiked whips, flasks with weird color liquids, chisels, and coal braziers.
