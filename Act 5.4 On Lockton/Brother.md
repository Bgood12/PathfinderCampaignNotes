If Eden inquires with her brother about the bounty on her, he will be initially surprised. He may note that their parents had brought it up before, but he'd dissuaded them from acting on it due to Eden's updates. 

After doing some research he will learn that High Queen Meira Wystan has been co-ruling with her reanimated brother in pseudo secret. And that her brother has been animating less by the day. Their parents now want Eden back due to the added incentive that she may cure the queen's brother and bring a boon upon their house.


Example Letter:
```
_Dearest Eden,_

I won’t lie—the news of a bounty came as a surprise. I had convinced them otherwise before. Your letters, however infrequent, were enough to keep them at bay. But things have changed.

I did some asking around. Word has reached our court that High Queen Meira Wystan has been ruling with her reanimated brother—yes, truly. But it’s no miracle. His condition is failing, day by day.

Mother and Father now believe that _you_, with your “unconventional studies,” might be able to reverse or halt his decay. They think you could win them royal favor—perhaps even another title.

They don’t want you home to keep you safe. They want you useful.

Stay hidden. Stay smart. And please, stay in touch.

_Your brother,_  
**Erick**
