**The Bumbling Bounty Hunter**
A nervous, underqualified, unprepared bounty hunter named Bellin Korr, confronts [[Eden Lockton|Eden]] publicly with a poorly drawn wanted poster and a vague description.
- A lot of stammering
- He might misidentify Eden at first
- His most dangerous weapon is a fishing net
- Wants her to come quietly - may suggest splitting the bounty
- Was given the task by a broker at a local pub

**The Ally**
[[Theodora 'Thea' Varko|Thea Varko]] mentions that Eden's name has been 'in the wind'. Acknowledges that the bounty, while substantial, isn't significant enough to get *really* serious hunters in pursuit.


**A Dockhand Recognizes Eden**
- Makes eye contact - gives a nervous nod
- Says nothing unless pressed
- Old dockmaster


**Former Classmate**
[[Jade Averian|Jade]] re-emerges. He's now a respected arcanist with ties to a mage's guild
- He was asked by Eden's parents directly to help locate her
- Is spotted in the distance, but disappears into the crowd
- Tracks the party down under the guise of academic curiosity, maybe as a favor
- Plays nice at first cordial, proud, maybe nostalgic
- Jade may have changed. If Eden shows growth he could become an unexpected ally
	- Or he's gather proof of her 'misdeeds'
