#### Beach and Secret Tunnel
You step onto a narrow stony beach beneath a looming cliff, with the waves crashing behind you. As you focus on the cliff wall a faint shimmer marks an illusion masking a tunnel mouth. The air within grows cool and damp, stagnant, smelling of wet stone and old iron.

A beach leads to a secret tunnel hidden by illusions placed by the original pirate king and largely forgotten.

#### Lift Area
A wooden lift dangles from thick ropes, parked in a yawning shaft. Lantern hang from hooks, their lights piercing the mists. A broad shouldered figure stands near the mechanism.
A barrel leaks blackpowder staining a nearby puddle like oil.

Vorgash's First Mate stands guard over the lift in case the source of the disturbance above uses it to enter the seacave.
A pair of snipers in the overlook (see below) have a visual of this area.

#### Cargo Area
Crates and barrels are stacked haphazardly on the damp stone floor, lashed with frayed ropes. Water drips constantly from the ceiling leaving slick stone underfoot. The scent of mildew mixes with gunpowder. 
Various cargo items


#### Jail
Iron barred cells are cut out of the cavern wall, corroding with rust but still sturdy. The cells reek of sweat, mold, and rot. Gaunt pirates sit slumped in chains, eyes hollow. A couple lie motionless, bodies stiffened by the damp. There's a steady drip of water.

Some pirates under Vorgash here because they were too loose lipped about the sea cave while on shore leave. A couple have died. 


#### Armory
Racks of mismatched weapons line the stone walls: cutlasses crusted with salt and heavy boarding axes worn from use. Iron and lamp oil permeates the air. A chest contains horns of powder and flint locks wrapped in oily leather. This is a cache of tools brutal and practical.
- Bucklers
- Cutlasses
- Boarding Axes
- Throwing Axes
- Crossbows
- Bolts
- Etc

#### Vault
Chests are stacked against a wall, locks rusted with barnacles. Gems glint faintly in the lamplight. Strange relics, maps inked on sharkskin, plunder from the seas.
Where Vorgash keeps his treasure hoard.

#### Vorgash's Chamber
In the stern of a long dead ship its hull wedged into the stone like the ribcage of a great beast. Barnacles crust the timbers, and the floor slopes unevenly on warped planks. 

Beneath a false floor, identifiable as it looks less warped than elsewhere, is a teleportation circle into Vorgash's chamber aboard his flagship.
