The Deck of this vessel has many pirates scurrying about trying to get the vessel seaworthy given the attack above. Also on board is a firearms merchant who's taken up in the crows nest and seeks to defend her client. And some more burly pirates.

Vorgash is in his cabin waiting for the fighting to die down. Vorgash knows that he won't be able to rally the isles if he fails here, and fight to the death.
Once he emerges Vorgash accuses the PCs of foolishness for challenging him and remarks that no one who had done so had ever lived to tell the tale.

"So, you're the fools bold enough to crawl into my domain. DO you understand whos wrath you've stirred? I am Vorgash Thrask, Pirate King of the Free Isles. None who have challenged me have lived to tell the tale. Their bones lie rotting in the deep, their names forgotten... soon, you'll join them."

```
Vorgash staggers as yourblow strikes true, a curse dying on his lips.His bulk crashes against the timbers of the ship, the sound echoing like a connon shot in the cavern. He glares at you -then his eyes sputter out.
