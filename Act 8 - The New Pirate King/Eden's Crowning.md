[[Theodora 'Thea' Varko|Thea]] will reconvene with the PCs prior to the celebration to ask who plans on ascending.
______________________________________________________________________
A the Jibblets enter the main hall pirates cheer clapping them on the shoulders and backs. Several attempt to place mugs of rum into their hands.  

Eventually Thea will grab the crowds attention:
```
"You all saw it with your own eyes. It wasn't Vorgash's who saved these isles. His ships didn't sail against Veriduna. It was them!"

*Turns toward the PCs, and Eden specifically*
"Here's to the ones who showed more steel than a so-called king. Without them we'd be carrion for Veriduna's gulls."

A barrel of sea water is poured over [[Eden Lockton|Eden's]] head, then she's lifted onto a table. The crowd roars, mugs are pounded onto tables. A signal goes off and a roar of cannons erupts from the nearby bay.
```

The crews erupt in noise -cheers, stomping boots, curses.

A rowdy feast breaks out , rum and ale flow, food is thrown onto tables, wild sea shanties are sung. 

Boastful tales are told of the PC's deeds 
- [[Sonja Krieg]] giving an exaggerated telling of how they split the [[Veriduna|Veridunan]] flagship in two with nothing but sheer grit.

PCs are pulled into toasts and forced into laughter.
- Mugs are raised in toast
- Tankards are shoved into hands
- [[Sonja Krieg]] - "Look at his face he hates the attention pour another one"
- [[Luca Romano]] - "You sent an empire packing. You can take a break."

"I heard they split the admiral in two with one blow"

#### Other Toasts
[['Admiral' Nylora Monteiro]]
- "I been fightin' [[Veriduna]] longer than most of you been breathin'. And I never thought I'd see the day they tucked tail like that. But _Sugar_, we saw it. You made an empire bleed."
[[Sonja Krieg]]
- Sonja whistles and a pterodon screeches overhead for emphasis (in the rafters)
[[Joseph (Sephy) Harlow]]
- Pulls [[Leaklen Plateau|Leaklen]] aside to tell him that he's become a story that they used to read about
[[Sylro]]
- Drifts to [[Yllavyre Enallyna|Ylla's]] side, voice pitched low. "Storms are easier to weather on deck than in the galley," he nods towards the door. Then moves toward the exit trusting [[Yllavyre Enallyna|Ylla]] to follow.




#### Other
If Ylla shares their circle's fate, [[Sylro]] will stand still for a long moment before saying that he doesn't have to carry this alone.
