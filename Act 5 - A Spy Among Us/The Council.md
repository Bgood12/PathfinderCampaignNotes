See [[The Council]] for members.
### Proposal 1
Topic: Full Share for The Howling Jib
Summary: Bypass the normal proving process in favor of immediately providing the Howling Jib a full share of the [[Balaika|Balaikan]] tithe.
Sponsor: [[Theodora 'Thea' Varko|Thea Varko]]
Champion: [[Theodora 'Thea' Varko|Thea Varko]]
Opposition: [[Pirate King - Vorgash Thrask]]
Initial Vote Count: 3 yay / 6 nay
DC: 26
Opening Argument (Thea Varko): 
“Let’s not pretend we don’t know talent when we see it. [[The Howling Jib]] sailed circles ‘round Redmane in the regatta, survived a Cannibal Isle, and exposed a spy ring. I say they've earned their full share. 
Opposition (Vorgash Thrask):  
“A crew still wet behind the ears shouldn’t leap the line just because Thea says so. Let ‘em prove themselves the right way. We start handing out shares without the proving, and every upstart thinks a flashy raid earns ‘em equal say.”

### Proposal 2
Topic: Standardized Code of Conduct (Optional Adoption)
Sponsor: Saraya Varn
Champion: Saraya Varn
Opposition: Lysanth Kalvrios
Initial Vote Count: 5 yay / 4 nay
DC: 19
Notes: Optional, but council endorsed code of conduct to reduce disputes at sea and elevate their own legitimacy. Way to influence behavior through peer pressure.
Opening Argument (Soraya Varn):  
“This isn’t about shoving rules down throats. It’s about clarity—clarity at sea, between ships, between deals. A standardized code, endorsed not enforced, gives us a stronger position when disputes rise or outsiders ask who we are. We don’t tame pirates—we give them the tools to keep their knives sharp.”
Opposition (Lysanth Kalvrios):  
“Paper doesn’t bind pirates. It strangles them. First it’s an optional code, then some port refuses your ship because it ‘isn’t compliant.’ Let’s not sell ourselves short with tidy little handbooks.”

### Proposal 3
Topic: Use of the [[Balaika|Balaikan]] tithe for public works.
Summary: Build a large gilded statue of [[Pirate King - Vorgash Thrask|Vorgash Thrask]] in the confederacy's major ports. The statues will dispense a stream of rum from their mouths.
Sponsor: Marven "Silkbeard" Jasto
Champion: Marven "Silkbeard" Jasto
Opposition: [[The Windrider]]
Initial Vote Count: 8 Yay/ 1 Nay
DC: 29/34
Opening Argument ("Silkbeard" Jasto):
“Now hear me out, mates. This ain’t just a statue, it’s a _symbol_. A symbol that says: ‘We’re _here_, and we’re united beneath the crown of salt and steel.’ Sail into any harbor and see that glinting likeness of the The Sea's Chosen King—mouth pourin’ rum for the weary, like Besmara himself winks at ya. It’s a rallying point, a legend in metal. Let’s give the people something to cheer—and drink—to.”
Opposition (The Windrider):
*Stands and slams table* "For those who haven't read it, this puts a gilded statue of Vorgash in every major port, in a fountain, full of rum that comes out of his mouth. This is nothin but a ridiculous waste of coin, for a vanity project put forth by a bootlicker."


### Proposal 4
Topic: Appraisal for the head of Kaelen Duskmere 
Sponsor: Drevik Thorne
Champion: Drevik Thorne
Opposition: [[Pirate King - Vorgash Thrask|Vorgash Thrask]]
Initial Vote Count: 4 yay / 5 nay
DC: 19
Notes: [[Captain Barthas Redmane]] has paid a hefty bribe to Drevik Thorne to have a bounty placed upon the head of one of his former officers. The alleged offence is unsanctioned piracy against [[Balaika|Balaikan]] allies. Redmane actually wants to see the death of his former officer because he leads through fear and doesn't want someone to manage to get away from him to survive.
Opening Argument (Drevik Thorne):  
“The man committed unsanctioned piracy against our allies, and from what I hear, spat on Balaikan soil to boot. We don’t protect mutineers. We reward their heads. We set a price (500gp). Send a message.”

### Proposal 5
Topic: Funds to combat Veridunan Agents
Sponsor: [[Theodora 'Thea' Varko|Thea Varko]]
Champion: [['Admiral' Nylora Monteiro]]
Opposition: [[Pirate King - Vorgash Thrask|Vorgash Thrask]]
Initial Vote Count: 3 yay / 6 nay
DC: 29
Notes: Comments from nearby tables about 'the pot calling the kettle black' and 'she seems a bit over eager to speak up' when the admiral begins championing.
Opening Argument (Admiral Nylora Monteiro):  
"You're right darlin'. Thems claws stretch farther then you think. Their eyes are in our harbors, their gold on our tables. We need funds, we need people, and we need to root ‘em out before they put roots in us.”
(_chuckles heard, muttered comments: “Says the one who wore their colors once.”_)
Opposition (Vorgash Thrask):  
"The Veridunans pose no threat. They'd have to sail round the entire Maelstrom to get to us. We're not fighting ghosts with coin. They show we burn 'em with fire. Act with steel not ledgers."
