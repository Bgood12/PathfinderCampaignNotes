Following the conclusion of [[The Regatta]] a representative of [[Theodora 'Thea' Varko|Thea Varko]] will covertly approach the Jibblets asking for a meeting. The meeting can be held at one of her manor/town houses either in [[Stormhaven]] or some other port. He requests their discretion in this matter, and doesn't know many details himself.

The representative is a half-elf named Sebastian. He seems well put together and has well kept brown hair and eyes, and wears non-descript clothing.

He will hand over a letter requesting the Jibblets' presence at dinner. The letter indicates that [[Theodora 'Thea' Varko|Thea Varko]] would like to recruit them for a sensitive task.

If the PCs attend one of her manor homes her retainers will show them into a dining hall with large windows overlooking the harbor. Once Thea arrives she will ask the Jibblets about what they know of the current politics in the confederacy. She will allude to the fact the the current pirate king's hold isn't as strong as many think. If pushed she will remark that his days are likely numbered and it is time for those with ambition to gather allies.

Thea will seque into [[Veriduna|Veriduna's]] designs on the isles. 
- "Their disdain is nothing new of course, but I've heard hints of another invasion"
- She is convinced that there is some truth to the rumors, but needs proof to convince the other captains to take united action
- She's too well known for such subtle work

Agreeing to the deal
- PCs have a powerful ally
- Will offer payment if they are hesitant
- Alliance must be kept on the down low
