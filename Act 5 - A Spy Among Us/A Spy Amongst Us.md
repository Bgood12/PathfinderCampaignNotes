[[Theodora 'Thea' Varko|Thea Varko]] gives the Jibblets two leads to follow regarding the suspected [[Veriduna|Veridunan]] spies.

**2. The Rumormonger**
[[Theodora 'Thea' Varko|Thea Varko's]] second lead through her contacts is a carver who had noticed odd smuggling activities.
Majan, the carver, can be found at the carver's guild most days.
- He can be convinced to tell the Jibblets about a smuggler named *Izreer* who doesn't seem to smuggle anything when he charters ships and never frequents the blackmarket scene in [[Stormhaven]].
See 3.

**3. Not Smuggler's Hut**
This hut belongs to Izreer a dwarven 'smuggler'. Izreer can be found here, dead for about a week behind a locked door with two arrows sticking out of his back. There's also an open rear window, and a fishtank in this room.

**4. The Devil's Due**
The Devil's Due is a small one room sloop. The interior is plastered with ichor and a small bug-like devil lies amidst the mess (Zebub). Having survived her assassination attempt Elois booked passage on the swiftest trading vessel that she could find.

**6. House of Huus/Assassination in Progress**
If Huus comes to his door an assassin will plant an arrow in his chest.
The assassin Calvus has been waiting on a roof across the way for hours waiting for his prey to show himself.
Calvus has a set of instructions on him "Use supplied dosage on each. I can offer more alongside payment"

If Huus is questioned he'll say that he primarily transfers messages between Ilinda and Venia at the alchemist's (Essential Embrocations) in [[Stormhaven]].
