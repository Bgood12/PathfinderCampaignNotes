A trident plundered by [[Unnamed Pirate Captain Antagonist]] during his brief and unexpected raid on a sea elf village.
[[Unnamed Pirate Captain Antagonist]] lost the amulet about half a year prior to the events of the campaign when he was captured by [[Veriduna]].

The trident itself has a design reminiscent of coral and can exert control over the wind and waves.
