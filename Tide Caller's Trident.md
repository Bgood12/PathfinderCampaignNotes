**30 Years Ago**
- High Councilor Elias Voss of [[Illurum]] notices a strange pattern of ocean currents and learns of the trident's power through a combination of covert research and spy networks. Recognizing the potential to control trade routes and gain significant political leverage, Voss approaches the sea elves with a proposal for an alliance.
- Voss presents himself as a benevolent ally, offering protection and support to the sea elves in exchange for their assistance in controlling the currents to benefit [[Illurum]]’s trade interests. The sea elves, valuing peace and cooperation, reluctantly agree to the arrangement.
- Over time, Voss becomes more manipulative, subtly increasing his demands and pushing the sea elves to exert more control over the trade routes. The sea elves, sensing his growing greed and the strain on their resources, express increased discomfort and reluctance.
- Realizing the immense power and potential of the trident, Voss becomes consumed by greed. He starts to see the sea elves as obstacles rather than allies. To secure the trident for himself and solidify his influence, Voss begins to plot an attack on the sea elf settlement.
- Voss covertly funds and organizes a mercenary force, recruiting pirates and mercenaries willing to carry out the assault. Among these hired forces is a pirate named [[Captain Barthas Redmane]], who is promised a share of the plunder for his participation.
- The attack is swift and brutal. The mercenaries, led by [[Captain Barthas Redmane]], descend upon the sea elf settlement. The sea elves are overwhelmed by the sheer force of the assault. Most are killed, and the settlement is left in ruins.
- In the chaos, the trident is taken by Voss’s forces. The surviving sea elves, traumatized and scattered, are left to mourn their losses and try to rebuild.
- With the trident in his possession, High Councilor Voss attempts to use its power to gain outsized influence over [[Illurum]] and its trade routes. Initially, his plan seems successful as he manipulates sea currents to favor [[Illurum]]’s ships, boosting his prestige and control.
- Voss’s overreach and the secretive nature of his acquisition raise suspicions among his rivals and the city's leadership. His actions destabilize the political balance, leading to intrigue and dissent.
- Eventually, a coalition of rival councilors and disaffected merchants expose Voss’s machinations. A swift political coup ensues, and Voss is overthrown. In the chaos, the trident is lost, disappearing amidst the turmoil of his downfall.
- [[Captain Barthas Redmane]], having pieced together the fate of the trident following Voss’s fall, sets out to find and retrieve the powerful artifact. Through cunning and determination, he eventually succeeds, securing the trident and using it to bolster his reputation and influence on the seas.
- [[Captain Barthas Redmane]] makes a name for himself as a pirate lord, though he never becomes the most dreaded pirate on the seas. His control over the sea currents grant him significant advantages.
- A branch of [[House Kasa]] from [[Veriduna]], wind up capturing [[Captain Barthas Redmane]] during one of his many acts of piracy. They recognize the trident’s value and take it for themselves intending to use it to conquer the [[Pirate Confederacy]] and reclaim their lost colony of [[Balaika]].

The trident itself has a design reminiscent of coral and can exert control over the wind and waves.
