Eden, Erick and the Jibblets are led to the palace's solar. The air is heavy with incense. The queen sits in a highbacked chair.

```
"Your brother speaks highly of you. He says that you're clever, bold, and willing to take risks that others would balk at."

*She leans forward and lowers her voice*

"Kardathos has enemies. I have enemies. If they sense weakness the vultures will circle. My brother shares my rule, but he is... unwell. His mind is fraying."

"He is still my brother, still my co-soverign. He cannot be replaced. If you have any skill, any insight, I beg of you: lend it to him. Even if only to slow the tide. It would mean evrything for him. For Kardathos."

*Her voice creaks with genuine fear*

"If you can do this, I will owe you. Kardathos will owe you. Debts of this crown are not forgotten."
```


The Queen leads Eden into a shuttered chamber. It smells of cloves, incense, and rot as the spices do their best to mask what lies beneath. The light is dim with only a few candles lit by the bed. 

On a large carved chair draped in silks sits Prince Osric of Kardathos. His skin sunken and pale, his eyes burning with cold intelligence.

*Raspy* "Another face... I hear you've a mind for risks. For survival. Tell me, child- do you think I am surviving? Or merely... lingering?"

He laughs, but the laugh breaks into a cough. Black ichor flecks the silk hankerchief he presses to his lips.

"You think me a curse wrapped in flesh. Do not lie. But, this realm was built on blood and fire. It needs me."

*His voice softens, becoming tired*

"Still... if you can, I would have more seasons of thought. Another chance to place the pieces... before I am gone."
