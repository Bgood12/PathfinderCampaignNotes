7-8 years ago the new [[Queen Meira Wystan]] approached the guild master of [[The Circle of The Sapphire Flame]] to resurrect her brother, [[Prince Osric Wystan]], who had fallen in the last days of her rebellion. Due to necromancy being generally frowned upon in [[Kardathos]] the mages were not experienced. The mages involved had little experience in the subject and those in the guild that know about it treat it like a dirty secret.


In the guild's vault is Osric's signet ring, used as a focus during the initial ritual 

The current guild master, a former officer involved in the ritual still keeps the original notes under lock and key. 
- Coded
- Studying can find flaws in the initial ritual, so that the tether can be cut without damaging Osric's essence
	- Ritual leaned on conjuration, transmutation, and planar theory


# [[Jade]]
**Gate Keeper of Knowledge**
- Threaten to expose Eden's inquiry unless bribed or bested.
	- Curry favor by rooting out meddlers
		- "I think Archmagus Deymaris would be pleased to know that someone is meddling in necromantic theory"

**Backhanded Ally?**
- Jade may come to respect [[Eden Lockton|Eden's]] determination, if she proves more competent than she remembers. And may assist if it's to his benefit.
	- Attempt to co-opt efforts

"I almost didn't recognize you without ink stains on your robes."
"I'd be careful these walls have no patience for dilettantes."

"If you were anyone else I'd laugh you out of the archives."
- "watching you grasp at something you can't hold. That may be worth my time."

**If helpful**
"Suppose I were to overlook a certain locked cabinet for a few minutes. Purely hypothetical, of course. What might you do with what's inside?"

"We both know that you'll need someone with actual training if you want results. Luckily I have a soft spot for hopeless causes."

"You're not the wide eyed fool I remember. I may start taking you seriously."


**Stealing Prestige**
Frames himself as the gatekeeper. Needed his access and credibility.
Praises Eden's imagination while downplaying her technical ability.
If successful push the narrative that her part was crucial.
Speaks of the event to authority wherever possible.


# [[Archmagus Seraphine Deymaris]]
The archmagus's office is lit by floating sapphire flames in glass orbs. The archmagus sits at a broad desk, cluttered with scrolls, tomes, and crystals organized immaculately. She regards visitors in silence for several seconds before speaking.

"Ambition and empathy often work hand in hand. Maybe you'll surprise me."
