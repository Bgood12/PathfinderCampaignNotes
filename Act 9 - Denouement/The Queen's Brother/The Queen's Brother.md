Osric's soul tether to The Boneyard is fraying.

Successful arcana/religion/occultism reveal that the weave sustaining him is tied to The Boneyard.

*Failure* - Osric's condition worsens leaving him writhing in necrotic pain. The Queen cuts the scene short, furious and grieving. Erick can insist that the party must leave.

*Success* - [[Eden Lockton|Eden]] halts his decline restoring clarity for some weeks or months. The queen Meira will attempt to indebt Eden to keep her around long term via promises, titles, or favors.
- Offers boons to get Eden to stay - titles, introductions at court, a discreet writ of favor
- "If conditions worsen, you will, aid again, yes?"
- "If you could do this once, you can do it again."

*Critically succeeding* at the ritual can rebind his soul to another tether, such as a phylactery. This can restore Osric fully.

Potential hazards
- Necromancers that want Eden's secrets
- Rival factions that don't like that she propped up the monarchy
