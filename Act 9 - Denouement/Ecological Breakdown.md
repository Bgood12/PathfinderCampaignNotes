### Local
#### Climate
- [[Zelvahar|Zelvahar Rainforest]] 
	- Rainfall decreases and evens out. The forest begins drying and slowly shrinks into a savannah
	- Rivers lose volume
	- Floodplains stabilize
		- Allows for new farming opportunities (local cultures progress technologically?)
	- Species adapted to the near permanent rainfall die off
		- Ferns, vines, mangroves, etc
	- Biodiversity shrinks - hardwoods and broadleaf trees may spread further

#### People
- [[Zelvahar|Zelvaharian]] tribes, clans, and citystates that have adapted to the storm heavily utilize canoes, flood farming, stilt houses.
	- Floodplain farming becomes easier at least for the short term
		- This encourages population growth and larger cities
	- The storm no longer provides protection 
		- More outsiders will arrive
		- Land routes open for trade
	- Potential for civil conflict
		- Many would have come to see [[The Maelstrom]] as divine.
			- Local shamans, scholars, etc will fight over the meaning of its sudden disappearance

### Distant
- More sea routes open for trade, colonization, and other imperial interests
	- Increase in piracy
- Disruptions to jet streams and ocean currents caused by [[The Maelstrom]]
	- Nearby deserts may see heavy rain for the first time in centuries
	- Coastlines may dry as the storm no longer sends water their way
	- Distant nations experience floods, droughts, or other strange weather

### Conflict
- Rainforest clans, tribes, and city-states war over new fertile lands.
- Various empires seek to claim the newly opened sea lanes (trade, colonization)
