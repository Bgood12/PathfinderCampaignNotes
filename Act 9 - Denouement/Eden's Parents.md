If met in public Eden's parents will display courtly grace. Every smile having a bit too much teeth.

Subtle guilt trips and attempts to reel Eden back in.

**Mother**
- Shock -> Containment
	- "Darling, I didn't expect you here. Lets... have supper together, hmm"
- Whatever Eden says that she has accomplished her mother will say that she could have done it within Kardathos - that she didn't need to run off
- Hints that the family could rise very high if Eden just plays along

**Father**
- Pragmatism
	- "We'll speak later. Quietly."


**The Bounty**
- Denial ("Nonsense! That's absurd gossip")
- Minimization ("It was... it was hardly a bounty, more of a... discreet request")
- Justification ("We thought you'd thank us for a way home")
- Might pressure Eden to not mention it to siblings under the guise of protecting them



#### Potential Dialogue
**Public**
Mother: "Eden! Stars, what a surprise. Look at you - you've grown into a striking young woman. Kardathos rejoices to see one of its daughters safe."
Father: "Ah, daughter. You couldn't keep away forever. Come let's catch up properly, shall we?"

**Private**
Mother: "Do you have any idea what we've endured not knowing where you were. Any information sparse as starlight. Now you stride in with your chin high as if nothing has ever happened. Eden... you can make something lasting here."
Father: "Kardathos is a place for loyalty, for family. If you could lend your strengths here, we could secure our name and a place for you at the heart of power."
Father: "Your talents reckless though they are could serve something greater."
Mother: "The queen's brother is ill Eden, you could help him. You could help us."
