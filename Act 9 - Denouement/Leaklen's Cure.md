**Institute for Bioarcanistry:**
```
Near the rupture, a structure with signage reading 'Zirnitran Institute for Bioarcanistry'.

Its walls are plated with a hexagonal gold-veined alloy, flickering with arcane glyphs and overgrown with anemonies.

Inside, the structure is remarkably well preserved. Structure intact but edges dulled by the stagnant waters. Corpses of test subjects and preserved chimeras rest in stasis and containment chambers - bloated and inhuman.

The water tastes wrong here clinical and metalic.
```

**Central Chamber:**
- Find a log of accumulated biological schematics of all test subjects and transformations that have occurred within the city. 
	- Notes about the stabilization pod.
- Find reference to 'Chimera Cores'


**Chimera Stabilization Pod:**
Location: In the ruins, deep within a quarantine vault surrounded by failed prototypes and corrupted test subjects.

An intact genetic stabilizer pod remains, but it's calibrated to suppress transformation, not grant duality.



=========


The Jibblets can modify the pods to work with the chimera cores granting Leaklen a neural trigger as a three action activity.
