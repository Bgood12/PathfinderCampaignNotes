Erick has deep knowledge about the planes, rituals, and warding magic
- "This is not a storm to be dispelled, but a wound to stitch shut"

Erick creates the ritual structure
- He drafts a binding lattice (giant sigil around the tear)
- Requires stabilizing keystones


### The Ritual
DCs = Level appropriate +2-3
**Start**
- The storm calms briefly then howls larger than ever
- Lightning arcs, water floats in impossible shapes

**Skill Challenge**
- Arcana/Occultism - to guide positioning of the keystones
- Athletics - Swim/move keystones to key locations
- Craft - Repair keystone that takes damage
- Thievery/Crafting - Properly anchor keystones so that they're not swept away
- Arcana/Occultism - Attune to a keystone aligning it to Erick's lattice
- Intimidation/Nature - Ward off/cow planar creatures/elementals that try to disrupt the work
- Performance - Lend rhythm to the arcane anchoring

**End**
- The Tear screams like the sound of a hurricane dying in seconds
