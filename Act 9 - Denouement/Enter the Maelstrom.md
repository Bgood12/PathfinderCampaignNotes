The Maelstrom:
```
The winds howl like gods screaming through an orchestra comprised only of brass instruments as the Howling Jib nears the center of the storm.

Then - **Silence**
You pass through the cyclone wall. Ribbons of water spiralupward, not down, pouring into the sky.

Beneath the sea a whirlpool of impossible depth, glowing faintly in blue and white.

```

Upon entering the whirlpool:
```
You dip into the vortex against the current. Your breath catches in your chest as the water turns *thick and cold and ancient*.

You fall and rise. The current rewrites gravity.
```

The Plane of Water:
```
There's a faint, pulsing, tug leading back to the wound, pulsing like a heartbeat, you've just passed through. From it spills the Maelstrom above the Material World, still powered by the rupture that dragged Zirnitra here. The sky above is still water, lit by clouds of glowing plankton, and distant archs of floating coral.

Around you towering spires of green-black stone twist upward, their sharp points long since worn smooth by the slow swaying grind of the tides. Coral growths pierce ancient masonry like bones jutting out of scar tissue. Vast archways gape open to nothing, once paved avenues spiral off into the abyss.

Massive shapes float by in the distance, half glimpsed - too large, too strange - unnameable.
